<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The House-boat of the Associated Shades, formerly located upon
the River Styx, as the reader may possibly remember, had been torn
from its moorings and navigated out into unknown seas by that
vengeful pirate Captain Kidd, aided and abetted by some of the most
ruffianly inhabitants of Hades. Like a thief in the night had they
come, and for no better reason than that the Captain had been
unanimously voted a shade too shady to associate with
self-respecting spirits had they made off with the happy floating
club-house of their betters; and worst of all, with them, by force
of circumstances over which they had no control, had sailed also
the fair Queen Elizabeth, the spirited Xanthippe, and every other
strong-minded and beautiful woman of Erebean society, whereby the
men thereof were rendered desolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; cried Raleigh,
desperately, as with his accustomed grace he presided over a
special meeting of the club, called on the bank of the inky Stygian
stream, at the point where the missing boat had been moored.
&ldquo;Think of it, gentlemen, Elizabeth of England, Calpurnia of
Rome, Ophelia of Denmark, and every precious jewel in our social
diadem gone, vanished completely; and with whom? Kidd, of all men
in the universe! Kidd, the pirate, the ruffian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take on so, my dear Sir Walter,&rdquo; said
Socrates, cheerfully. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of going into
hysterics? You are not a woman, and should eschew that luxury.
Xanthippe is with them, and I&rsquo;ll warrant you that when that
cherished spouse of mine has recovered from the effects of the sea,
say the third day out, Kidd and his crew will be walking the plank,
and voluntarily at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the House-boat itself,&rdquo; murmured Noah, sadly.
&ldquo;That was my delight. It reminded me in some respects of the
Ark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law of compensation enters in there, my dear
Commodore,&rdquo; retorted Socrates. &ldquo;For me, with Xanthippe
abroad I do not need a club to go to; I can stay at home and take
my hemlock in peace and straight. Xanthippe always compelled me to
dilute it at the rate of one quart of water to the
finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t all marry Xanthippe,&rdquo; put in
C&aelig;sar, firmly, &ldquo;therefore we are not all satisfied with
the situation. I, for one, quite agree with Sir Walter that
something must be done, and quickly. Are we to sit here and do
nothing, allowing that fiend to kidnap our wives with
impunity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; interposed Bonaparte. &ldquo;The time
for action has arrived. All things considered he is welcome to
Marie Louise, but the idea of Josephine going off on a cruise of
that kind breaks my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No question about it,&rdquo; observed Dr. Johnson.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do something if it is only for the sake
of appearances. The question really is, what shall be done
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in favor of taking a drink as the first step, and
considering the matter of further action afterwards,&rdquo;
suggested Shakespeare, and it was this suggestion that made the
members unanimous upon the necessity for immediate action, for when
the assembled spirits called for their various favorite beverages
it was found that there were none to be had, it being Sunday, and
all the establishments wherein liquid refreshments were licensed to
be sold being closed&mdash;for at the time of writing the local
government of Hades was in the hands of the reform party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Socrates. &ldquo;Nothing but Styx
water and vitriol, Sundays? Then the House-boat must be recovered
whether Xanthippe comes with it or not. Sir Walter, I am for
immediate action, after all. This ruffian should be captured at
once and made an example of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Socrates,&rdquo; put in Lindley Murray,
&ldquo;but, ah&mdash;pray speak in Greek hereafter, will you,
please? When you attempt English you have a beastly way of working
up to climatic prepositions which are offensive to the ear of a
purist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time to discuss style, Murray,&rdquo;
interposed Sir Walter. &ldquo;Socrates may speak and spell like
Chaucer if he pleases; he may even part his infinitives in the
middle, for all I care. We have affairs of greater moment in
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must ransack the earth,&rdquo; cried Socrates,
&ldquo;until we find that boat. I&rsquo;m dry as a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes again!&rdquo; growled Murray. &ldquo;Dry as
a fish! What fish I&rsquo;d like to know is dry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red herrings,&rdquo; retorted Socrates; and there was a
great laugh at the expense of the purist, in which even Hamlet, who
had grown more and more melancholy and morbid since the abduction
of Ophelia, joined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is settled,&rdquo; said Raleigh; &ldquo;something
must be done. And now the point is, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relief expeditions have a way of finding things,&rdquo;
suggested Dr. Livingstone. &ldquo;Or rather of being found by the
things they go out to relieve. I propose that we send out a number
of them. I will take Africa; Bonaparte can lead an expedition into
Europe; General Washington may have North America;
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; put in Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;but have
you any idea, Dr. Livingstone, that Captain Kidd has put wheels on
this House-boat of ours and is having it dragged across the Sahara
by mules or camels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such absurd idea ever entered my head,&rdquo; retorted
the Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you then believe that he has put runners on it, and is
engaged in the pleasurable pastime of taking the ladies tobogganing
down the Alps?&rdquo; persisted the philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. Why do you ask?&rdquo; queried the African
explorer, irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wish to know,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;That
is always my motive in asking questions. You propose to go looking
for a house-boat in Central Africa; you suggest that Bonaparte lead
an expedition in search of it through Europe&mdash;all of which
strikes me as nonsense. This search is the work of sea-dogs, not of
landlubbers. You might as well ask Confucius to look for it in the
heart of China. What earthly use there is in ransacking the earth I
fail to see. What we need is a naval expedition to scour the sea,
unless it is pretty well understood in advance that we believe Kidd
has hauled the boat out of the water, and is now using it for a
roller-skating rink or a bicycle academy in Ohio, or for some other
purpose for which neither he nor it was designed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s point is well taken,&rdquo; said a
stranger who had been sitting upon the string-piece of the pier,
quietly, but with very evident interest, listening to the
discussion. He was a tall and excessively slender shade,
&ldquo;like a spirt of steam out of a teapot,&rdquo; as Johnson put
it afterwards, so slight he seemed. &ldquo;I have not the honor of
being a member of this association,&rdquo; the stranger continued,
&ldquo;but, like all well-ordered shades, I aspire to the
distinction, and I hold myself and my talents at the disposal of
this club. I fancy it will not take us long to establish our
initial point, which is that the gross person who has so foully
appropriated your property to his own base uses does not
contemplate removing it from its keel and placing it somewhere
inland. All the evidence in hand points to a radically different
conclusion, which is my sole reason for doubting the value of that
conclusion. Captain Kidd is a seafarer by instinct, not a landsman.
The House-boat is not a house, but a boat; therefore the place to
look for it is not, as Dr. Johnson so well says, in the Sahara
Desert, or on the Alps, or in the State of Ohio, but upon the high
sea, or upon the waterfront of some one of the world&rsquo;s great
cities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON&rsquo;S POINT IS WELL
TAKEN&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what, then, would be your plan?&rdquo; asked Sir
Walter, impressed by the stranger&rsquo;s manner as well as by the
very manifest reason in all that he had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chartering of a suitable vessel, fully armed and
equipped for the purpose of pursuit. Ascertain whither the
House-boat has sailed, for what port, and start at once. Have you a
model of the House-boat within reach?&rdquo; returned the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not; we have the architect&rsquo;s plans,
however,&rdquo; said the chairman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had, Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Demosthenes, who was
secretary of the House Committee, rising, &ldquo;but they are gone
with the House-boat itself. They were kept in the safe in the
hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of annoyance came into the face of the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a
most important part of my plan that we should know about how fast
the House-boat was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated Socrates, with ill-concealed
sarcasm. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll take Xanthippe&rsquo;s word for it,
the House-boat was the fastest yacht afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to the matter of speed in sailing,&rdquo;
returned the stranger, quietly. &ldquo;The question of its ethical
speed has nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The designer of the craft is here,&rdquo; said Sir
Walter, fixing his eyes upon Sir Christopher Wren. &ldquo;It is
possible that he may be of assistance in settling that
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has all this got to do with the question, anyhow,
Mr. Chairman?&rdquo; asked Solomon, rising impatiently and
addressing Sir Walter. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t preparing for a
yacht-race that I know of. Nobody&rsquo;s after a cup, or a
championship of any kind. What we do want is to get our wives back.
The Captain hasn&rsquo;t taken more than half of mine along with
him, but I am interested none the less. The Queen of Sheba is on
board, and I am somewhat interested in her fate. So I ask you what
earthly or unearthly use there is in discussing this question of
speed in the House-boat. It strikes me as a woful waste of time,
and rather unprecedented too, that we should suspend all rules and
listen to the talk of an entire stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_02.jpg"><img src=
"images/sm_illo_02.jpg" alt=
"A kingly man addresses the surrounding gentlemen" title=
"&ldquo;&lsquo;WHAT HAS ALL THIS GOT TO DO WITH THE QUESTION?&rsquo;&rdquo;"
id="illo_02" name="illo_02" width="154" height="216" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;WHAT HAS ALL THIS GOT TO DO WITH THE
QUESTION?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not venture to doubt the wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo;
said Johnson, dryly, &ldquo;but I must say that the
gentleman&rsquo;s remarks rather interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they do,&rdquo; ejaculated Solomon. &ldquo;He
agreed with you. That ought to make him interesting to everybody.
Freaks usually are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the reason at all,&rdquo; retorted Dr.
Johnson. &ldquo;Cold water agrees with me, but it doesn&rsquo;t
interest me. What I do think, however, is that our unknown friend
seems to have a grasp on the situation by which we are confronted,
and he&rsquo;s going at the matter in hand in a very comprehensive
fashion. I move, therefore, that Solomon be laid on the table, and
that the privileges of the&mdash;ah&mdash;of the wharf be extended
indefinitely to our friend on the string-piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motion, having been seconded, was duly carried, and the
stranger resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will explain for the benefit of his Majesty King
Solomon, whose wisdom I have always admired, and whose endurance as
the husband of three hundred wives has filled me with
wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that before starting in pursuit of
the stolen vessel we must select a craft of some sort for the
purpose, and that in selecting the pursuer it is quite essential
that we should choose a vessel of greater speed than the one we
desire to overtake. It would hardly be proper, I think, if the
House-boat can sail four knots an hour, to attempt to overhaul her
with a launch, or other nautical craft, with a maximum speed of two
knots an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; ejaculated C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my reason, your Majesty, for inquiring as to the
speed of your late club-house,&rdquo; said the stranger, bowing
courteously to Solomon. &ldquo;Now if Sir Christopher Wren can give
me her measurements, we can very soon determine at about what rate
she is leaving us behind under favorable circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t necessary for Sir Christopher to do
anything of the sort,&rdquo; said Noah, rising and manifesting
somewhat more heat than the occasion seemed to require. &ldquo;As
long as we are discussing the question I will take the liberty of
stating what I have never mentioned before, that the designer of
the House-boat merely appropriated the lines of the Ark. Shem, Ham,
and Japhet will bear testimony to the truth of that
statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no quarrel on that score, Mr.
Chairman,&rdquo; assented Sir Christopher, with cutting frigidity.
&ldquo;I am perfectly willing to admit that practically the two
vessels were built on the same lines, but with modifications which
would enable my boat to sail twenty miles to windward and back in
six days less time than it would have taken the Ark to cover the
same distance, and it could have taken all the wash of the
excursion steamers into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; ejaculated Noah, angrily. &ldquo;Strip your
old tub down to a flying balloon-jib and a marline-spike, and
ballast the Ark with elephants until every inch of her reeked with
ivory and peanuts, and she&rsquo;d outfoot you on every leg, in a
cyclone or a zephyr. Give me the Ark and a breeze, and your
House-boat wouldn&rsquo;t be within hailing distance of her five
minutes after the start if she had 40,000 square yards of canvas
spread before a gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This discussion is waxing very unprofitable,&rdquo;
observed Confucius. &ldquo;If these gentlemen cannot be made to
confine themselves to the subject that is agitating this body, I
move we call in the authorities and have them confined in the
bottomless pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not precipitate the quarrel,&rdquo; said Noah.
&ldquo;I was merely trying to assist our friend on the
string-piece. I was going to say that as the Ark was probably a
hundred times faster than Sir Christopher Wren&rsquo;s&mdash;tub,
which he himself says can take care of all the wash of the
excursion boats, thereby becoming on his own admission a
wash-tub&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order! order!&rdquo; cried Sir Christopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say that this wash-tub could be overhauled
by a launch or any other craft with a speed of thirty knots a
month,&rdquo; continued Noah, ignoring the interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took him forty days to get to Mount Ararat!&rdquo;
sneered Sir Christopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your boat would have got there two weeks sooner,
I&rsquo;ll admit,&rdquo; retorted Noah, &ldquo;if she&rsquo;d
sprung a leak at the right time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granting the truth of Noah&rsquo;s statement,&rdquo; said
Sir Walter, motioning to the angry architect to be
quiet&mdash;&ldquo;not that we take any side in the issue between
the two gentlemen, but merely for the sake of argument&mdash;I wish
to ask the stranger who has been good enough to interest himself in
our trouble what he proposes to do&mdash;how can you establish your
course in case a boat were provided?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also vot vill be dher gost, if any?&rdquo; put in
Shylock.</p>
<p>A murmur of disapprobation greeted this remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cost need not trouble you, sir,&rdquo; said Sir
Walter, indignantly, addressing the stranger; &ldquo;you will have
carte blanche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den ve are ruint!&rdquo; cried Shylock, displaying his
palms, and showing by that act a select assortment of diamond
rings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; laughed the stranger, &ldquo;that is a simple
matter. Captain Kidd has gone to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To London!&rdquo; cried several members at once.
&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this,&rdquo; said the stranger, holding up the tiny
stub end of a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut-tut!&rdquo; ejaculated Solomon. &ldquo;What
child&rsquo;s play this is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your Majesty,&rdquo; observed the stranger, &ldquo;it
is not child&rsquo;s play; it is fact. That cigar end was thrown
aside here on the wharf by Captain Kidd just before he stepped on
board the House-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; demanded Raleigh. &ldquo;And
granting the truth of the assertion, what does it prove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said the stranger. And he at once
proceeded as follows.</p>
<h3><a name="Ch_II" id="Ch_II">II</a></h3>
<h2>The Stranger Unravels a Mystery and Reveals Himself</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made a hobby of the study of cigar ends,&rdquo;
said the stranger, as the Associated Shades settled back to hear
his account of himself. &ldquo;From my earliest youth, when I used
surreptitiously to remove the unsmoked ends of my father&rsquo;s
cigars and break them up, and, in hiding, smoke them in an old clay
pipe which I had presented to me by an ancient sea-captain of my
acquaintance, I have been interested in tobacco in all forms, even
including these self-same despised unsmoked ends; for they convey
to my mind messages, sentiments, farces, comedies, and tragedies
which to your minds would never become manifest through their
agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company drew closer together and formed themselves in a more
compact mass about the speaker. It was evident that they were
beginning to feel an unusual interest in this extraordinary person,
who had come among them unheralded and unknown. Even Shylock
stopped calculating percentages for an instant to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell us,&rdquo; demanded Shakespeare,
&ldquo;that the unsmoked stub of a cigar will suggest the story of
him who smoked it to your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied the stranger, with a confident
smile. &ldquo;Take this one, for instance, that I have picked up
here upon the wharf; it tells me the whole story of the intentions
of Captain Kidd at the moment when, in utter disregard of your
rights, he stepped aboard your House-boat, and, in his usual
piratical fashion, made off with it into unknown seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know he smoked it?&rdquo; asked Solomon,
who deemed it the part of wisdom to be suspicious of the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two curious indentations in it which prove
that. The marks of two teeth, with a hiatus between, which you will
see if you look closely,&rdquo; said the stranger, handing the
small bit of tobacco to Sir Walter, &ldquo;make that point evident
beyond peradventure. The Captain lost an eye-tooth in one of his
later raids; it was knocked out by a marline-spike which had been
hurled at him by one of the crew of the treasure-ship he and his
followers had attacked. The adjacent teeth were broken, but not
removed. The cigar end bears the marks of those two jagged molars,
with the hiatus, which, as I have indicated, is due to the
destruction of the eye-tooth between them. It is not likely that
there was another man in the pirate&rsquo;s crew with teeth exactly
like the commander&rsquo;s, therefore I say there can be no doubt
that the cigar end was that of the Captain himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting indeed,&rdquo; observed Blackstone,
removing his wig and fanning himself with it; &ldquo;but I must
confess, Mr. Chairman, that in any properly constituted law court
this evidence would long since have been ruled out as irrelevant
and absurd. The idea of two or three hundred dignified spirits like
ourselves, gathered together to devise a means for the recovery of
our property and the rescue of our wives, yielding the floor to the
delivering of a lecture by an entire stranger on &lsquo;Cigar Ends
He Has Met,&rsquo; strikes me as ridiculous in the extreme. Of what
earthly interest is it to us to know that this or that cigar was
smoked by Captain Kidd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely that it will help us on, your honor, to discover
the whereabouts of the said Kidd,&rdquo; interposed the stranger.
&ldquo;It is by trifles, seeming trifles, that the greatest
detective work is done. My friends Le Coq, Hawkshaw, and Old Sleuth
will bear me out in this, I think, however much in other respects
our methods may have differed. They left no stone unturned in the
pursuit of a criminal; no detail, however trifling, uncared for. No
more should we in the present instance overlook the minutest bit of
evidence, however irrelevant and absurd at first blush it may
appear to be. The truth of what I say was very effectually proven
in the strange case of the Brokedale tiara, in which I figured
somewhat conspicuously, but which I have never made public, because
it involves a secret affecting the integrity of one of the noblest
families in the British Empire. I really believe that mystery was
solved easily and at once because I happened to remember that the
number of my watch was 86507B. How trivial a thing, and yet how
important it was, as the event transpired, you will realize when I
tell you the incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s manner was so impressive that there was a
unanimous and simultaneous movement upon the part of all present to
get up closer, so as the more readily to hear what he said, as a
result of which poor old Boswell was pushed overboard, and fell
with a loud splash into the Styx. Fortunately, however, one of
Charon&rsquo;s pleasure-boats was close at hand, and in a short
while the dripping, sputtering spirit was drawn into it, wrung out,
and sent home to dry. The excitement attending this diversion
having subsided, Solomon asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the incident of the lost tiara?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_03.jpg"><img src=

title="&ldquo;POOR OLD BOSWELL WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD&rdquo;" id=
"illo_03" name="illo_03" width="147" height="216" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;POOR OLD BOSWELL WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am about to tell you,&rdquo; returned the stranger;
&ldquo;and it must be understood that you are told in the strictest
confidence, for, as I say, the incident involves a state secret of
great magnitude. In life&mdash;in the mortal life&mdash;gentlemen,
I was a detective by profession, and, if I do say it, who perhaps
should not, I was one of the most interesting for purely literary
purposes that has ever been known. I did not find it necessary to
go about saying &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; as M. Le Coq was accustomed
to do to advertise his cleverness; neither did I disguise myself as
a drum-major and hide under a kitchen-table for the purpose of
solving a mystery involving the abduction of a parlor stove, after
the manner of the talented Hawkshaw. By mental concentration alone,
without fireworks or orchestral accompaniment of any sort
whatsoever, did I go about my business, and for that very reason
many of my fellow-sleuths were forced to go out of real detective
work into that line of the business with which the stage has
familiarized the most of us&mdash;a line in which nothing but
stupidity, luck, and a yellow wig is required of him who pursues
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is an impostor,&rdquo; whispered Le Coq to
Hawkshaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known that all along by the mole on his left
wrist,&rdquo; returned Hawkshaw, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected it the minute I saw he was not
disguised,&rdquo; returned Le Coq, knowingly. &ldquo;I have
observed that the greatest villains latterly have discarded
disguises, as being too easily penetrated, and therefore of no
avail, and merely a useless expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Confucius, impatiently. &ldquo;How
can the gentleman proceed, with all this conversation going on in
the rear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawkshaw and Le Coq immediately subsided, and the stranger went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in this way that I treated the strange case of the
lost tiara,&rdquo; resumed the stranger. &ldquo;Mental
concentration upon seemingly insignificant details alone enabled me
to bring about the desired results in that instance. A brief
outline of the case is as follows: It was late one evening in the
early spring of 1894. The London season was at its height. Dances,
f&ecirc;tes of all kinds, opera, and the theatres were in full
blast, when all of a sudden society was paralyzed by a most
audacious robbery. A diamond tiara valued at &pound;50,000 sterling
had been stolen from the Duchess of Brokedale, and under
circumstances which threw society itself and every individual in it
under suspicion&mdash;even his Royal Highness the Prince himself,
for he had danced frequently with the Duchess, and was known to be
a great admirer of her tiara. It was at half-past eleven
o&rsquo;clock at night that the news of the robbery first came to
my ears. I had been spending the evening alone in my library making
notes for a second volume of my memoirs, and, feeling somewhat
depressed, I was on the point of going out for my usual midnight
walk on Hampstead Heath, when one of my servants, hastily entering,
informed me of the robbery. I changed my mind in respect to my
midnight walk immediately upon receipt of the news, for I knew that
before one o&rsquo;clock some one would call upon me at my lodgings
with reference to this robbery. It could not be otherwise. Any
mystery of such magnitude could no more be taken to another bureau
than elephants could fly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to,&rdquo; said Adam. &ldquo;I once had a whole
aviary full of winged elephants. They flew from flower to flower,
and thrusting their probabilities deep into&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their what?&rdquo; queried Johnson, with a frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probabilities&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the word? Their
trunks,&rdquo; said Adam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probosces, I imagine you mean,&rdquo; suggested
Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that was it. Their probosces,&rdquo; said Adam.
&ldquo;They were great honey-gatherers, those elephants&mdash;far
better than the bees, because they could make so much more of it in
a given time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Munchausen shook his head sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
I&rsquo;m outclassed by these antediluvians,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen! gentlemen!&rdquo; cried Sir Walter.
&ldquo;These interruptions are inexcusable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; said the stranger, with
some asperity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having about as hard a time getting
this story out as I would if it were a serial. Of course, if you
gentlemen do not wish to hear it, I can stop; but it must be
understood that when I do stop I stop finally, once and for all,
because the tale has not a sufficiency of dramatic climaxes to
warrant its prolongation over the usual magazine period of twelve
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo; cried some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried others&mdash;addressing the
interrupting members, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; resumed the stranger, &ldquo;I
felt confident that within an hour, in some way or other, that case
would be placed in my hands. It would be mine either positively or
negatively&mdash;that is to say, either the person robbed would
employ me to ferret out the mystery and recover the diamonds, or
the robber himself, actuated by motives of self-preservation, would
endeavor to direct my energies into other channels until he should
have the time to dispose of his ill-gotten booty. A mental
discussion of the probabilities inclined me to believe that the
latter would be the case. I reasoned in this fashion: The person
robbed is of exalted rank. She cannot move rapidly because she is
so. Great bodies move slowly. It is probable that it will be a week
before, according to the etiquette by which she is hedged about,
she can communicate with me. In the first place, she must inform
one of her attendants that she has been robbed. He must communicate
the news to the functionary in charge of her residence, who will
communicate with the Home Secretary, and from him will issue the
orders to the police, who, baffled at every step, will finally
address themselves to me. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give that side two
weeks,&rsquo; I said. On the other hand, the robber: will he allow
himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by counting on
this delay, or will he not, noting my habit of occasionally
entering upon detective enterprises of this nature of my own
volition, come to me at once and set me to work ferreting out some
crime that has never been committed? My feeling was that this would
happen, and I pulled out my watch to see if it were not nearly time
for him to arrive. The robbery had taken place at a state ball at
the Buckingham Palace. &lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; I mused. &lsquo;He
has had an hour and forty minutes to get here. It is now twelve
twenty. He should be here by twelve forty-five. I will wait.&rsquo;
And hastily swallowing a cocaine tablet to nerve myself up for the
meeting, I sat down and began to read my Schopenhauer. Hardly had I
perused a page when there came a tap upon my door. I rose with a
smile, for I thought I knew what was to happen, opened the door,
and there stood, much to my surprise, the husband of the lady whose
tiara was missing. It was the Duke of Brokedale himself. It is true
he was disguised. His beard was powdered until it looked like snow,
and he wore a wig and a pair of green goggles; but I recognized him
at once by his lack of manners, which is an unmistakable sign of
nobility. As I opened the door, he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are Mr.&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;Come in. You have
come to see me about your stolen watch. It is a gold hunting-case
watch with a Swiss movement; loses five minutes a day; stem-winder;
and the back cover, which does not bear any inscription, has upon
it the indentations made by the molars of your son Willie when that
interesting youth was cutting his teeth upon it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; cried Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask how you knew all that?&rdquo; asked Solomon,
deeply impressed. &ldquo;Such penetration strikes me as
marvellous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; replied the stranger, with
a smile. &ldquo;What I said was intended to be jocular, and to put
Brokedale at his ease. The Americans present, with their usual
astuteness, would term it bluff. It was. I merely rattled on. I
simply did not wish to offend the gentleman by letting him know
that I had penetrated his disguise. Imagine my surprise, however,
when his eye brightened as I spoke, and he entered my room with
such alacrity that half the powder which he thought disguised his
beard was shaken off on to the floor. Sitting down in the chair I
had just vacated, he quietly remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are a wonderful man, sir. How did you know
that I had lost my watch?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a moment I was nonplussed; more than that, I was
completely staggered. I had expected him to say at once that he had
not lost his watch, but had come to see me about the tiara; and to
have him take my words seriously was entirely unexpected and
overwhelmingly surprising. However, in view of his rank, I deemed
it well to fall in with his humor. &lsquo;Oh, as for that,&rsquo; I
replied, &lsquo;that is a part of my business. It is the
detective&rsquo;s place to know everything; and generally, if he
reveals the machinery by means of which he reaches his conclusions,
he is a fool, since his method is his secret, and his secret his
stock in trade. I do not mind telling you, however, that I knew
your watch was stolen by your anxious glance at my clock, which
showed that you wished to know the time. Now most rich Americans
have watches for that purpose, and have no hesitation about showing
them. If you&rsquo;d had a watch, you&rsquo;d have looked at it,
not at my clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My visitor laughed, and repeated what he had said about
my being a wonderful man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the dents which my son made cutting his
teeth?&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Invariably go with an American&rsquo;s watch.
Rubber or ivory rings aren&rsquo;t good enough for American babies
to chew on,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;They must have gold watches or
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And finally, how did you know I was a rich
American?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because no other can afford to stop at hotels like
the Savoy in the height of the season,&rsquo; I replied, thinking
that the jest would end there, and that he would now reveal his
identity and speak of the tiara. To my surprise, however, he did
nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have an almost supernatural gift,&rsquo; he
said. &lsquo;My name is Bunker. I <em>am</em> stopping at the
Savoy. I <em>am</em> an American. I <em>was</em> rich when I
arrived here, but I&rsquo;m not quite so bloated with wealth as I
was, now that I have paid my first week&rsquo;s bill. I
<em>have</em> lost my watch; such a watch, too, as you describe,
even to the dents. Your only mistake was that the dents were made
by my son John, and not Willie; but even there I cannot but wonder
at you, for John and Willie are twins, and so much alike that it
sometimes baffles even their mother to tell them apart. The watch
has no very great value intrinsically, but the associations are
such that I want it back, and I will pay &pound;200 for its
recovery. I have no clew as to who took it. It was
numbered&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here a happy thought struck me. In all my description of
the watch I had merely described my own, a very cheap affair which
I had won at a raffle. My visitor was deceiving me, though for what
purpose I did not on the instant divine. No one would like to
suspect him of having purloined his wife&rsquo;s tiara. Why should
I not deceive him, and at the same time get rid of my poor
chronometer for a sum that exceeded its value a
hundredfold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good business!&rdquo; cried Shylock.</p>
<p>The stranger smiled and bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I took the words right
out of his mouth. &lsquo;It was numbered 86507B!&rsquo; I cried,
giving, of course, the number of my own watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gazed at me narrowly for a moment, and then he smiled.
&lsquo;You grow more marvellous at every step. That was indeed the
number. Are you a demon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;Only something of a
mind-reader.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be brief, the bargain was struck. I was to look
for a watch that I knew he hadn&rsquo;t lost, and was to receive
&pound;200 if I found it. It seemed to him to be a very good
bargain, as, indeed, it was, from his point of view, feeling, as he
did, that there never having been any such watch, it could not be
recovered, and little suspecting that two could play at his little
game of deception, and that under any circumstances I could foist a
ten-shilling watch upon him for two hundred pounds. This business
concluded, he started to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a little Scotch?&rsquo; I
asked, as he started, feeling, with all that prospective profit in
view, I could well afford the expense. &lsquo;It is a stormy
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thanks, I will,&rsquo; said he, returning and
seating himself by my table&mdash;still, to my surprise, keeping
his hat on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me take your hat,&rsquo; I said, little
thinking that my courtesy would reveal the true state of affairs.
The mere mention of the word hat brought about a terrible change in
my visitor; his knees trembled, his face grew ghastly, and he
clutched the brim of his beaver until it cracked. He then nervously
removed it, and I noticed a dull red mark running about his
forehead, just as there would be on the forehead of a man whose hat
fitted too tightly; and that mark, gentlemen, had the undulating
outline of nothing more nor less than a tiara, and on the apex of
the uppermost extremity was a deep indentation about the size of a
shilling, that could have been made only by some adamantine
substance! The mystery was solved! The robber of the Duchess of
Brokedale stood before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suppressed murmur of excitement went through the assembled
spirits, and even Messrs. Hawkshaw and Le Coq were silent in the
presence of such genius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plan of action was immediately formulated. The man was
completely at my mercy. He had stolen the tiara, and had it
concealed in the lining of his hat. I rose and locked the door. My
visitor sank with a groan into my chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why did you do that?&rsquo; he stammered, as I
turned the key in the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To keep my Scotch whiskey from evaporating,&rsquo;
I said, dryly. &lsquo;Now, my lord,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;it will
pay your Grace to let me have your hat. I know who you are. You are
the Duke of Brokedale. The Duchess of Brokedale has lost a valuable
tiara of diamonds, and you have not lost your watch. Somebody has
stolen the diamonds, and it may be that somewhere there is a Bunker
who has lost such a watch as I have described. The queer part of it
all is,&rsquo; I continued, handing him the decanter, and taking a
couple of loaded six-shooters out of my escritoire&mdash;&lsquo;the
queer part of it all is that I have the watch and you have the
tiara. We&rsquo;ll swap the swag. Hand over the bauble,
please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But&mdash;&rsquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We won&rsquo;t have any butting, your
Grace,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the watch, and you
needn&rsquo;t mind the &pound;200; and you must give me the tiara,
or I&rsquo;ll accompany you forthwith to the police, and have a
search made of your hat. It won&rsquo;t pay you to defy me. Give it
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave up the hat at once, and, as I suspected, there
lay the tiara, snugly stowed away behind the head-band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are a great fellow.&rsquo; said I, as I held
the tiara up to the light and watched with pleasure the flashing
brilliance of its gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg you&rsquo;ll not expose me,&rsquo; he
moaned. &lsquo;I was driven to it by necessity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;As long as you
play fair it will be all right. I&rsquo;m not going to keep this
thing. I&rsquo;m not married, and so have no use for such a trifle;
but what I do intend is simply to wait until your wife retains me
to find it, and then I&rsquo;ll find it and get the reward. If you
keep perfectly still, I&rsquo;ll have it found in such a fashion
that you&rsquo;ll never be suspected. If, on the other hand, you
say a word about to-night&rsquo;s events, I&rsquo;ll hand you over
to the police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
prove a case against me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can prove any case against anybody,&rsquo; I
retorted. &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe it, read my
book,&rsquo; I added, and I handed him a copy of my memoirs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve read it,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;and
I ought to have known better than to come here. I thought you were
only a literary success.&rsquo; And with a deep-drawn sigh he took
the watch and went out. Ten days later I was retained by the
Duchess, and after a pretended search of ten days more I found the
tiara, restored it to the noble lady, and received the &pound;5000
reward. The Duke kept perfectly quiet about our little encounter,
and afterwards we became stanch friends; for he was a good fellow,
and was driven to his desperate deed only by the demands of his
creditors, and the following Christmas he sent me the watch I had
given him, with the best wishes of the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see, gentlemen, in a moment, by quick wit and a
mental concentration of no mean order, combined with strict
observance of the pettiest details, I ferreted out what bade fair
to become a great diamond mystery; and when I say that this cigar
end proves certain things to my mind, it does not become you to
doubt the value of my conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; cried Raleigh, growing tumultuous with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name? your name?&rdquo; came from all parts of the
wharf.</p>
<p>The stranger, putting his hand into the folds of his coat, drew
forth a bundle of business cards, which he tossed, as the
prestidigitator tosses playing-cards, out among the audience, and
on each of them was found printed the words:</p>
<div style="width:60%;margin:auto;border:thin black solid;">

<p class="cen"><em>Plots for Sale.</em></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think he made a mistake in not taking the &pound;200
for the watch. Such carelessness destroys my confidence in
him,&rdquo; said Shylock, who was the first to recover from the
surprise of the revelation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo; said Sir Walter Raleigh, after
three rousing cheers, led by Hamlet, had been given with a will by
the assembled spirits, &ldquo;after this demonstration in your
honor I think it is hardly necessary for me to assure you of our
hearty co-operation in anything you may venture to suggest. There
is still manifest, however, some desire on the part of the
ever-wise King Solomon and my friend Confucius to know how you
deduce that Kidd has sailed for London, from the cigar end which
you hold in your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_05.jpg"><img src=

<p>&ldquo;THREE ROUSING CHEERS, LED BY HAMLET, WERE
GIVEN&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can easily satisfy their curiosity,&rdquo; said
Sherlock Holmes, genially. &ldquo;I believe I have already proven
that it is the end of Kidd&rsquo;s cigar. The marks of the teeth
have shown that. Now observe how closely it is smoked&mdash;there
is barely enough of it left for one to insert between his teeth.
Now Captain Kidd would hardly have risked the edges of his mustache
and the comfort of his lips by smoking a cigar down to the very
light if he had had another; nor would he under any circumstances
have smoked it that far unless he were passionately addicted to
this particular brand of the weed. Therefore I say to you, first,
this was his cigar; second, it was the last one he had; third, he
is a confirmed smoker. The result, he has gone to the one place in
the world where these Connecticut hand-rolled Havana
cigars&mdash;for I recognize this as one of them&mdash;have a real
popularity, and are therefore more certainly obtainable, and that
is at London. You cannot get so vile a cigar as that outside of a
London hotel. If I could have seen a quarter-inch more of it, I
should have been able definitely to locate the hotel itself. The
wrappers unroll to a degree that varies perceptibly as between the
different hotels. The Metropole cigar can be smoked a quarter
through before its wrapper gives way; the Grand wrapper goes as
soon as you light the cigar; whereas the Savoy, fronting on the
Thames, is surrounded by a moister atmosphere than the others, and,
as a consequence, the wrapper will hold really until most people
are willing to throw the whole thing away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really a wonderful art!&rdquo; said Solomon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The making of a Connecticut Havana cigar?&rdquo; laughed
Holmes. &ldquo;Not at all. Give me a head of lettuce and a straw,
and I&rsquo;ll make you a box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I referred to your art&mdash;that of detection,&rdquo;
said Solomon. &ldquo;Your logic is perfect; step by step we have
been led to the irresistible conclusion that Kidd has made for
London, and can be found at one of these hotels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only until next Tuesday, when he will take a house in
the neighborhood of Scotland Yard,&rdquo; put in Holmes, quickly,
observing a sneer on Hawkshaw&rsquo;s lips, and hastening to
overwhelm him by further evidence of his ingenuity. &ldquo;When he
gets his bill he will open his piratical eyes so wide that he will
be seized with jealousy to think of how much more refined his
profession has become since he left it, and out of mere pique he
will leave the hotel, and, to show himself still cleverer than his
modern prototypes, he will leave his account unpaid, with the
result that the affair will be put in the hands of the police,
under which circumstances a house in the immediate vicinity of the
famous police headquarters will be the safest hiding-place he can
find, as was instanced by the remarkable case of the famous
Penstock bond robbery. A certain church-warden named Hinkley,
having been appointed cashier thereof, robbed the Penstock Imperial
Bank of &pound;1,000,000 in bonds, and, fleeing to London, actually
joined the detective force at Scotland Yard, and was detailed to
find himself, which of course he never did, nor would he ever have
been found had he not crossed my path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawkshaw gazed mournfully off into space, and Le Coq muttered
profane words under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in the same class with this fellow,
Hawkshaw,&rdquo; said Le Coq. &ldquo;You could tap your forehead
knowingly eight hours a day through all eternity with a
sledge-hammer without loosening an idea like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless I&rsquo;ll confound him yet,&rdquo; growled
the jealous detective. &ldquo;I shall myself go to London, and,
disguised as Captain Kidd, will lead this visionary on until he
comes there to arrest me, and when these club members discover that
it is Hawkshaw and not Kidd he has run to earth, we&rsquo;ll have a
great laugh on Sherlock Holmes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am anxious to hear how you solved the bond-robbery
mystery,&rdquo; said Socrates, wrapping his toga closely about him
and settling back against one of the spiles of the wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we all,&rdquo; said Sir Walter. &ldquo;But
meantime the House-boat is getting farther away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless she&rsquo;s sailing backwards,&rdquo; sneered
Noah, who was still nursing his resentment against Sir Christopher
Wren for his reflections upon the speed of the Ark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; asked Socrates. &ldquo;I
believe in making haste slowly; and on the admission of our two
eminent naval architects, Sir Christopher and Noah, neither of
their vessels can travel more than a mile a week, and if we charter
the <em>Flying Dutchman</em> to go in pursuit of her we can catch
her before she gets out of the Styx into the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonah might lend us his whale, if the beast is in
commission,&rdquo; suggested Munchausen, dryly. &ldquo;I for one
would rather take a state-room in Jonah&rsquo;s whale than go
aboard the <em>Flying Dutchman</em> again. I made one trip on the
<em>Dutchman</em>, and she&rsquo;s worse than a dory for comfort;
furthermore, I don&rsquo;t see what good it would do us to charter
a boat that can&rsquo;t land oftener than once in seven years, and
spends most of her time trying to double the Cape of Good
Hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My whale is in commission,&rdquo; said Jonah, with
dignity. &ldquo;But Baron Munchausen need not consider the question
of taking a state-room aboard of her. She doesn&rsquo;t carry
second-class passengers. And if I took any stock in the idea of a
trip on the <em>Flying Dutchman</em> amounting to a seven
years&rsquo; exile, I would cheerfully pay the Baron&rsquo;s
expenses for a round trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are losing time, gentlemen,&rdquo; suggested Sherlock
Holmes. &ldquo;This is a moment, I think, when you should lay aside
personal differences and personal preferences for immediate action.
I have examined the wake of the House-boat, and I judge from the
condition of what, for want of a better term, I may call the suds,
when she left us the House-boat was making ten knots a day. Almost
any craft we can find suitably manned ought to be able to do better
than that; and if you could summon Charon and ascertain what boats
he has at hand, it would be for the good of all
concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good plan,&rdquo; said Johnson.
&ldquo;Boswell, see if you can find Charon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here already, sir,&rdquo; returned the ferryman,
rising. &ldquo;Most of my boats have gone into winter quarters,
your Honor. The <em>Mayflower</em> went into dry dock last week to
be calked up; the <em>Pinta</em> and the <em>Santa Maria</em> are
slow and cranky; the <em>Monitor</em> and the <em>Merrimac</em> I
haven&rsquo;t really had time to patch up; and the
<em>Valkyrie</em> is two months overdue. I cannot make up my mind
whether she is lost or kept back by excursion steamers. Hence I
really don&rsquo;t know what I can lend you. Any of these boats I
have named you could have had for nothing; but my others are
actively employed, and I couldn&rsquo;t let them go without a
serious interference with my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man blinked sorrowfully across the waters at the
opposite shore. It was quite evident that he realized what a
dreadful expense the club was about to be put to, and while of
course there would be profit in it for him, he was sincerely sorry
for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;those boats you could
have had for nothing, but the others I&rsquo;d have to charge you
for, though of course I&rsquo;ll give you a discount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he blinked again, as he meditated upon whether that discount
should be an eighth or one-quarter of one per cent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>Flying Dutchman</em>,&rdquo; he pursued,
&ldquo;ain&rsquo;t no good for your purposes. She&rsquo;s too fast.
She&rsquo;s built to fly by, not to stop. You&rsquo;d catch up with
the House-boat in a minute with her, but you&rsquo;d go right on
and disappear like a visionary; and as for the Ark, she&rsquo;d
never do&mdash;with all respect to Mr. Noah. She&rsquo;s just about
as suitable as any other waterlogged cattle-steamer&rsquo;d be, and
no more&mdash;first-rate for elephants and kangaroos, but no good
for cruiser-work, and so slow she wouldn&rsquo;t make a ripple high
enough to drown a gnat going at the top of her speed. Furthermore,
she&rsquo;s got a great big hole in her bottom, where she was stove
in by running afoul of&mdash;Mount Arrus-root, I believe it was
called when Captain Noah went cruising with that menagerie of
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an unmitigated falsehood!&rdquo; cried Noah,
angrily. &ldquo;This man talks like a professional amateur
yachtsman. He has no regard for facts, but simply goes ahead and
makes statements with an utter disregard of the truth. The Ark was
not stove in. We beached her very successfully. I say this in
defence of my seamanship, which was top-notch for my
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t sail six weeks without fouling a
mountain-peak!&rdquo; sneered Wren, perceiving a chance to get
even.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hole&rsquo;s there, just the same,&rdquo; said
Charon. &ldquo;Maybe she was a centreboard, and that&rsquo;s where
you kept the board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hole is there because it was worn there by one of the
elephants,&rdquo; retorted Noah. &ldquo;You get a beast like the
elephant shuffling one of his fore-feet up and down, up and down, a
plank for twenty-four hours a day for forty days in one of your
boats, and see where your boat would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Charon, calmly. &ldquo;But the
elephants don&rsquo;t patronize my line. All the elephants
I&rsquo;ve ever seen in Hades waded over, except Jumbo, and he
reached his trunk across, fastened on to a tree limb with it, and
swung himself over. However, the Ark isn&rsquo;t at all what you
want, unless you are going to man her with a lot of centaurs. If
that&rsquo;s your intention, I&rsquo;d charter her; the
accommodations are just the thing for a crew of that
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you suggest?&rdquo; asked Raleigh, somewhat
impatiently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told us what we can&rsquo;t do.
Now tell us what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stay right here,&rdquo; said Charon, &ldquo;and
let the ladies rescue themselves. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do.
I&rsquo;ve had the honor of bringing &lsquo;em over here, and I
think I know &lsquo;em pretty well. I&rsquo;ve watched &lsquo;em
close, and it&rsquo;s my private opinion that before many days
you&rsquo;ll see your club-house sailing back here, with Queen
Elizabeth at the hellum, and the other ladies on the for&rsquo;ard
deck knittin&rsquo; and crochetin&rsquo;, and tearin&rsquo; each
other to pieces in a conversational way, as happy as if there never
had been any Captain Kidd and his pirate crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suggestion is impossible,&rdquo; said Blackstone,
rising. &ldquo;Whether the relief expedition amounts to anything or
not, it&rsquo;s good to be set going. The ladies would never
forgive us if we sat here inactive, even if they were capable of
rescuing themselves. It is an accepted principle of law that this
climate hath no fury like a woman left to herself, and we&rsquo;ve
got enough professional furies hereabouts without our aiding in
augmenting the ranks. We must have a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll cost you a thousand dollars a week,&rdquo;
said Charon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll subscribe fifty,&rdquo; cried Hamlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll consult my secretary,&rdquo; said Solomon,
&ldquo;and find out how many of my wives have been abducted, and
I&rsquo;ll pay ten dollars apiece for their recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s liberal,&rdquo; said Hawkshaw. &ldquo;There
are sixty-three of &lsquo;em on board, together with eighty of his
fianc&eacute;es. What&rsquo;s the quotation on fianc&eacute;es,
King Solomon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
mine yet, and it&rsquo;s their fathers&rsquo; business to get
&lsquo;em back. Not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other subscriptions came pouring in, and it was not long before
everybody save Shylock had put his name down for something. This
some one of the more quick-witted of the spirits soon observed,
and, with reckless disregard of the feelings of the Merchant of
Venice, began to call: &ldquo;Shylock! Shylock! How
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Merchant tried to leave the pier, but his path was
blocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subscribe, subscribe!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;How
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order, gentlemen, order!&rdquo; said Sir Walter, rising
and holding a bottle aloft. &ldquo;A black person by the name of
Friday, a valet of our friend Mr. Crusoe, has just handed me this
bottle, which he picked up ten minutes ago on the bank of the river
a few miles distant. It contains a bit of paper, and may perhaps
give us a clew based upon something more substantial than even the
wonderful theories of our new brother Holmes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_06.jpg"><img src=

name="illo_06" width="216" height="171" /></a>
<p>A BLACK PERSON BY THE NAME OF FRIDAY FINDS A BOTTLE</p>
</div>
<p>A deathly silence followed the chairman&rsquo;s words, as Sir
Walter drew a cork-screw from his pocket and opened the bottle. He
extracted the paper, and, as he had surmised, it proved to be a
message from the missing vessel. His face brightening with a smile
of relief, Sir Walter read, aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have just emerged into the Atlantic. Club in hands of
Kidd and forty ruffians. One hundred and eighty-three ladies on
board. Headed for the Azores. Send aid at once. All well except
Xanthippe, who is seasick in the billiard-room. (Signed)
Portia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried Hawkshaw. &ldquo;That shows how
valuable the Holmes theory is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;No woman knows
anything about seafaring, but Portia is right. The ship is headed
for the Azores, which is the first tack needed in a windward sail
for London under the present conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply was greeted with cheers, and when they subsided the
cry for Shylock&rsquo;s subscription began again, but he
declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had intended to put up a thousand ducats,&rdquo; he
said, defiantly, &ldquo;but with that woman Portia on board I
won&rsquo;t give a red obolus!&rdquo; and with that he wrapped his
cloak about him and stalked off into the gathering shadows of the
wood.</p>
<p>And so the funds were raised without the aid of Shylock, and the
shapely twin-screw steamer the <em>Gehenna</em> was chartered of
Charon, and put under the command of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who,
after he had thanked the company for their confidence, walked
abstractedly away, observing in strictest confidence to himself
that he had done well to prepare that bottle beforehand and bribe
Crusoe&rsquo;s man to find it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now,&rdquo; he said, with a chuckle, &ldquo;I can get
back to earth again free of cost on my own hook, whether my eminent
inventor wants me there or not. I never approved of his killing me
off as he did at the very height of my popularity.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>On Board the House-Boat</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile the ladies were not having such a bad time, after all.
Once having gained possession of the House-boat, they were loath to
think of ever having to give it up again, and it is an open
question in my mind if they would not have made off with it
themselves had Captain Kidd and his men not done it for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive these men for their selfishness
in monopolizing all this,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, with a vicious
stroke of a billiard-cue, which missed the cue-ball and tore a
right angle in the cloth. &ldquo;It is not right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Portia. &ldquo;It is all wrong; and when
we get back home I&rsquo;m going to give my beloved Bassanio a
piece of my mind; and if he doesn&rsquo;t give in to me, I&rsquo;ll
reverse my decision in the famous case of Shylock <em>versus</em>
Antonio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I sincerely hope he doesn&rsquo;t give in,&rdquo;
retorted Cleopatra, &ldquo;for I swear by all my auburn locks that
that was the very worst bit of injustice ever perpetrated. Mr.
Shakespeare confided to me one night, at one of Mrs.
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s card-parties, that he regarded that as the
biggest joke he ever wrote, and Judge Blackstone observed to Antony
that the decision wouldn&rsquo;t have held in any court of equity
outside of Venice. If you owe a man a thousand ducats, and it costs
you three thousand to get them, that&rsquo;s your affair, not his.
If it cost Antonio every drop of his bluest blood to pay the pound
of flesh, it was Antonio&rsquo;s affair, not Shylock&rsquo;s.
However, the world applauds you as a great jurist, when you have
nothing more than a woman&rsquo;s keen instinct for sentimental
technicalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have made a horrid play, though, if it had gone
on,&rdquo; shuddered Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but, carried out realistically, it would
have done away with a raft of bad actors,&rdquo; said Cleopatra.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half sorry it didn&rsquo;t go on, and I&rsquo;m
sure it wouldn&rsquo;t have been any worse than compelling Brutus
to fall on his sword until he resembles a chicken liver <em>en
brochette</em>, as is done in that Julius C&aelig;sar
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very glad I did it,&rdquo; snapped
Portia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would be,&rdquo; said Cleopatra.
&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t done it, you&rsquo;d never have been
known. What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat had given a slight lurch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear a shuffling noise up on deck,
Portia?&rdquo; asked the Egyptian Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did, and it seemed as if the vessel had moved
a bit,&rdquo; returned Portia, nervously; for, like most women in
an advanced state of development, she had become a martyr to her
nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was merely the wash from one of Charon&rsquo;s new
ferry-boats, I fancy,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, calmly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgusting, the way that old fellow allows these
modern innovations to be brought in here! As if the old
paddle-boats he used to carry shades in weren&rsquo;t good enough
for the immigrants of this age! Really this Styx River is losing a
great deal of its charm. Sir Walter and I were upset, while out
rowing one day last summer, by the waves kicked up by one of
Charon&rsquo;s excursion steamers going up the river with a party
of picnickers from the city&mdash;the Greater Gehenna Chowder Club,
I believe it was&mdash;on board of her. One might just as well live
in the midst of the turmoil of a great city as try to get
uninterrupted quiet here in the suburbs in these days. Charon
isn&rsquo;t content to get rich slowly; he must make money by the
barrelful, if he has to sacrifice all the comfort of everybody
living on this river. Anybody&rsquo;d think he was an American, the
way he goes on; and everybody else here is the same way. The
Erebeans are getting to be a race of shopkeepers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think myself,&rdquo; sighed Cleopatra, &ldquo;that
Hades is being spoiled by the introduction of American
ideas&mdash;it is getting by far too democratic for my tastes; and
if it isn&rsquo;t stopped, it&rsquo;s my belief that the best
people will stop coming here. Take Madame R&eacute;camier&rsquo;s
salon as it is now and compare it with what it used to be! In the
early days, after her arrival here, everybody went because it was
the swell thing, and you&rsquo;d be sure of meeting the
intellectually elect. On the one hand you&rsquo;d find Sophocles;
on the other, Cicero; across the room would be Horace chatting
gayly with some such person as myself. Great warriors, from
Alexander to Bonaparte, were there, and glad of the opportunity to
be there, too; statesmen like Macchiavelli; artists like Cellini or
Tintoretto. You couldn&rsquo;t move without stepping on the toes of
genius. But now all is different. The money-getting instinct has
been aroused within them all, with the result that when I invited
Mozart to meet a few friends at dinner at my place last autumn, he
sent me a card stating his terms for dinners. Let me see, I think I
have it with me; I&rsquo;ve kept it by me for fear of losing it, it
is such a complete revelation of the actual condition of affairs in
this locality. Ah! this is it,&rdquo; she added, taking a small bit
of paste-board from her card-case. &ldquo;Read that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The card was passed about, and all the ladies were much
astonished&mdash;and naturally so, for it ran this wise:</p>
<div style=

<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; tittered Elizabeth, as she read.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that extraordinary? He&rsquo;s got the
three-name craze, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly ridiculous,&rdquo; said Cleopatra.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s fairer than Artemus Ward&rsquo;s plan. Mozart
gives notice of his intentions to charge you; but with Ward
it&rsquo;s different. He comes, and afterwards sends a bill for his
fun. Why, only last week I got a &lsquo;quarterly statement&rsquo;
from him showing a charge against me of thirty-eight dollars for
humorous remarks made to my guests at a little chafing-dish party I
gave in honor of Balzac, and, worst of all, he had marked it
&lsquo;Please remit.&rsquo; Even Antony, when he wrote a sonnet to
my eyebrow, wouldn&rsquo;t let me have it until he had heard
whether or not Boswell wanted it for publication in the
<em>Gossip</em>. With Rubens giving chalk-talks for pay, Phidias
doing &lsquo;Five-minute Masterpieces in Putty&rsquo; for suburban
lyceums, and all the illustrious in other lines turning their
genius to account through the entertainment bureaus, it&rsquo;s
impossible to have a salon now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are indeed right,&rdquo; said Madame R&eacute;camier,
sadly. &ldquo;Those were palmy days when genius was satisfied with
chicken salad and lemonade. I shall never forget those nights when
the wit and wisdom of all time were&mdash;ah&mdash;were on tap at
my house, if I may so speak, at a cost to me of lights and supper.
Now the only people who will come for nothing are those we used to
think of paying to stay away. Boswell is always ready, but you
can&rsquo;t run a salon on Boswell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Portia, &ldquo;I sincerely hope that
you won&rsquo;t give up the functions altogether, because I have
always found them most delightful. It is still possible to have
lights and supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a plan for next winter,&rdquo; said Madame
R&eacute;camier, &ldquo;but I suppose I shall be accused of going
into the commercial side of it if I adopt it. The plan is, briefly,
to incorporate my salon. That&rsquo;s an idea worthy of an
American, I admit; but if I don&rsquo;t do it I&rsquo;ll have to
give it up entirely, which, as you intimate, would be too bad. An
incorporated salon, however, would be a grand thing, if only
because it would perpetuate the salon. &lsquo;The R&eacute;camier
Salon (Limited)&rsquo; would be a most excellent title, and,
suitably capitalized, would enable us to pay our lions
sufficiently. Private enterprise is powerless under modern
conditions. It&rsquo;s as much as I can afford to pay for a dinner,
without running up an expense account for guests; and unless we get
up a salon trust, as it were, the whole affair must go to the
wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>MADAME R&Eacute;CAMIER HAS A PLAN</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;How would you make it pay?&rdquo; asked Portia. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t see where your dividends would come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is simple enough,&rdquo; said Madame
R&eacute;camier. &ldquo;We could put up a large reception-hall with
a portion of our capital, and advertise a series of
nights&mdash;say one a week throughout the season. These would be
Warriors&rsquo; Night, Story-tellers&rsquo; Night, Poets&rsquo;
Night, Chafing-dish Night under the charge of Brillat-Savarin, and
so on. It would be understood that on these particular evenings the
most interesting people in certain lines would be present, and
would mix with outsiders, who should be admitted only on payment of
a certain sum of money. The commonplace inhabitants of this country
could thus meet the truly great; and if I know them well, as I
think I do, they&rsquo;ll pay readily for the privilege. The
obscure love to rub up against the famous here as well as they do
on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d run a sort of Social Zoo?&rdquo; suggested
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely; and provide entertainment for private
residences too. An advertisement in Boswell&rsquo;s paper, which
everybody buys&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which nobody reads,&rdquo; said Portia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They read the advertisements,&rdquo; retorted Madame
R&eacute;camier. &ldquo;As I was saying, an advertisement could be
placed in Boswell&rsquo;s paper as follows: &lsquo;Are you giving a
Function? Do you want Talent? Get your Genius at the
R&eacute;camier Salon (Limited).&rsquo; It would be simply
magnificent as a business enterprise. The common herd would be
tickled to death if they could get great people at their homes,
even if they had to pay roundly for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would look well in the society notes, wouldn&rsquo;t
it, if Mr. John Boggs gave a reception, and at the close of the
account it said, &lsquo;The supper was furnished by Calizetti, and
the genius by the R&eacute;camier Salon (Limited)&rsquo;?&rdquo;
suggested Elizabeth, scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must admit,&rdquo; replied the French lady, &ldquo;that
you call up an unpleasant possibility, but I don&rsquo;t really see
what else we can do if we want to preserve the salon idea. Somebody
has told these talented people that they have a commercial value,
and they are availing themselves of the demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sad age!&rdquo; sighed Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say is just this,&rdquo; put
in Xanthippe: &ldquo;You people who get up functions have brought
this condition of affairs on yourselves. You were not satisfied to
go ahead and indulge your passion for lions in a moderate fashion.
Take the case of Demosthenes last winter, for instance. His wife
told me that he dined at home three times during the winter. The
rest of the time he was out, here, there, and everywhere, making
after-dinner speeches. The saving on his dinner bills didn&rsquo;t
pay his pebble account, much less remunerate him for his time, and
the fearful expense of nervous energy to which he was subjected. It
was as much as she could do, she said, to keep him from shaving one
side of his head, so that he couldn&rsquo;t go out, the way he used
to do in Athens when he was afraid he would be invited out and
couldn&rsquo;t scare up a decent excuse for refusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he do that?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, with a roar of
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the cyclop&aelig;dias say. It&rsquo;s a good plan,
too,&rdquo; said Xanthippe. &ldquo;Though Socrates never had to do
it. When I got the notion Socrates was going out too much, I used
to hide his dress clothes. Then there was the case of Rubens. He
gave a Carbon Talk at the Sforza&rsquo;s Thursday Night Club,
merely to oblige Madame Sforza, and three weeks later discovered
that she had sold his pictures to pay for her gown! You people
simply run it into the ground. You kill the goose that when taken
at the flood leads on to fortune. It advertises you, does the lion
no good, and he is expected to be satisfied with confectionery,
material and theoretical. If they are getting tired of candy and
compliments, it&rsquo;s because you have forced too much of it upon
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They like it, just the same,&rdquo; retorted
R&eacute;camier. &ldquo;A genius likes nothing better than the
sound of his own voice, when he feels that it is falling on
aristocratic ears. The social laurel rests pleasantly on many a
noble brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Xanthippe. &ldquo;But when a man gets a
pile of Christmas wreaths a mile high on his head, he begins to
wonder what they will bring on the market. An occasional wreath is
very nice, but by the ton they are apt to weigh on his mind. Up to
a certain point notoriety is like a woman, and a man is apt to love
it; but when it becomes exacting, demanding instead of permitting
itself to be courted, it loses its charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Socratic in its wisdom,&rdquo; smiled Portia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Xanthippic in its origin,&rdquo; returned Xanthippe.
&ldquo;No man ever gave me my ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Xanthippe spoke, Lucretia Borgia burst into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry and save yourselves!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The
boat has broken loose from her moorings, and is floating down the
stream. If we don&rsquo;t hurry up and do something, we&rsquo;ll
drift out to sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Cleopatra, dropping her cue in terror,
and rushing for the stairs. &ldquo;I was certain I felt a slight
motion. You said it was the wash from one of Charon&rsquo;s barges,
Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, following
closely after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; moaned Lucretia Borgia.
&ldquo;Calpurnia just looked out of the window and discovered that
we were in mid-stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies crowded anxiously about the stair and attempted to
ascend, Cleopatra in the van; but as the Egyptian Queen reached the
doorway to the upper deck, the door opened, and the hard features
of Captain Kidd were thrust roughly through, and his strident voice
rang out through the gathering gloom. &ldquo;Pipe my eye for a
sardine if we haven&rsquo;t captured a female seminary!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;THE HARD FEATURES OF KIDD WERE THRUST THROUGH&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And one by one the ladies, in terror, shrank back into the
billiard-room, while Kidd, overcome by surprise, slammed the door
to, and retreated into the darkness of the forward deck to consult
with his followers as to &ldquo;what next.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>A Conference on Deck</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a kettle of fish!&rdquo; said Kidd, pulling
his chin whisker in perplexity as he and his fellow-pirates
gathered about the capstan to discuss the situation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if in all my experience I ever sailed
athwart anything like it afore! Pirating with a lot of low-down
ruffians like you gentlemen is bad enough, but on a craft loaded to
the water&rsquo;s edge with advanced women&mdash;I&rsquo;ve half a
mind to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_09.jpg"><img src=

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;HERE&rsquo;S A KETTLE OF FISH,&rsquo; SAID
KIDD&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, you swim&mdash;we&rsquo;ll not turn back with
you,&rdquo; retorted Abeuchapeta, whom, in honor of his prowess,
Kidd had appointed executive officer of the House-boat. &ldquo;I
have no desire to be mutinous, Captain Kidd, but I have not
embarked upon this enterprise for a pleasure sail down the Styx. I
am out for business. If you had thirty thousand women on board,
still should I not turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall we do with &lsquo;em?&rdquo; pleaded Kidd.
&ldquo;Where can we go without attracting attention? Who&rsquo;s
going to feed &lsquo;em? Who&rsquo;s going to dress &lsquo;em?
Who&rsquo;s going to keep &lsquo;em in bonnets? You don&rsquo;t
know anything about these creatures, my dear Abeuchapeta; and,
by-the-way, can&rsquo;t we arbitrate that name of yours? It would
be fearful to remember in the excitement of a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call him Ab,&rdquo; suggested Sir Henry Morgan, with an
ill-concealed sneer, for he was deeply jealous of
Abeuchapeta&rsquo;s preferral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do I&rsquo;ll call you Morgue, and change your
appearance to fit,&rdquo; retorted Abeuchapeta, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the beards of all my sainted Buccaneers,&rdquo; began
Morgan, springing angrily to his feet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have your
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen! Gentlemen&mdash;my noble ruffians!&rdquo;
expostulated Kidd. &ldquo;Come, come; this will never do! I must
have no quarrelling among my aides. This is no time for divisions
in our councils. An entirely unexpected element has entered into
our affairs, and it behooveth us to act in concert. It is no light
matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, captain,&rdquo; said Abeuchapeta, &ldquo;but
that is where you and I do not agree. We&rsquo;ve got our ship and
we&rsquo;ve got our crew, and in addition we find that the Fates
have thrown in a hundred or more women to act as ballast. Now I,
for one, do not fear a woman. We can set them to work. There is
plenty for them to do keeping things tidy; and if we get into a
very hard fight, and come out of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e somewhat
the worse for wear, it will be a blessing to have &lsquo;em along
to mend our togas, sew buttons on our uniforms, and darn our
hosiery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgan laughed sarcastically. &ldquo;When did you flourish, if
ever, colonel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you refer to me?&rdquo; queried Abeuchapeta, with a
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have guessed correctly,&rdquo; replied Morgan, icily.
&ldquo;I have quite forgotten your date; were you a success in the
year one, or when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admiral Abeuchapeta, Sir Henry,&rdquo; interposed Kidd,
fearing a further outbreak of hostilities&mdash;&ldquo;Admiral
Abeuchapeta was the terror of the seas in the seventh century, and
what he undertook to do he did, and his piratical enterprises were
carried on on a scale of magnificence which is without parallel off
the comic-opera stage. He never went forth without at least seventy
galleys and a hundred other vessels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abeuchapeta drew himself up proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six-ninety-eight was my great year,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; said Morgan.
&ldquo;That is to say, you got your ideas of women twelve hundred
years ago, and the ladies have changed somewhat since that time. I
have great respect for you, sir, as a ruffian. I have no doubt that
as a ruffian you are a complete success, but when it comes to
&lsquo;feminology&rsquo; you are sailing in unknown waters. The
study of women, my dear Abeuchadnezzar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peta,&rdquo; retorted Abeuchapeta, irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stand corrected. The study of women, my dear
Peter,&rdquo; said Morgan, with a wink at Conrad, which fortunately
the seventh-century pirate did not see, else there would have been
an open break&mdash;&ldquo;the study of women is more difficult
than that of astronomy; there may be two stars alike, but all women
are unique. Because she was this, that, or the other thing in your
day does not prove that she is any one of those things in our
day&mdash;in fact, it proves the contrary. Why, I venture even to
say that no individual woman is alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a hazy thought,&rdquo; said Kidd,
scratching his head in a puzzled sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that she&rsquo;s different from herself at
different times,&rdquo; said Morgan. &ldquo;What is it the poet
called her?&mdash;&lsquo;an infinite variety show,&rsquo; or
something of that sort; a perpetual vaudeville&mdash;a continuous
performance, as it were, from twelve to twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan is right, admiral!&rdquo; put in Conrad the
corsair, acting temporarily as bo&rsquo;sun. &ldquo;The times are
sadly changed, and woman is no longer what she was. She is hardly
what she is, much less what she was. The Roman Gyn&aelig;ceum would
be an impossibility to-day. You might as well expect Delilah to
open a barbershop on board this boat as ask any of these advanced
females below-stairs to sew buttons on a pirate&rsquo;s uniform
after a fray, or to keep the fringe on his epaulets curled.
They&rsquo;re no longer sewing-machines&mdash;they are Keeley
motors for mystery and perpetual motion. Women have views
now&mdash;they are no longer content to be looked at merely; they
must see for themselves; and the more they see, the more they wish
to domesticate man and emancipate woman. It&rsquo;s my private
opinion that if we are to get along with them at all the best thing
to do is to let &lsquo;em alone. I have always found I was better
off in the abstract, and if this question is going to be settled in
a purely democratic fashion by submitting it to a vote, I&rsquo;ll
vote for any measure which involves leaving them strictly to
themselves. They&rsquo;re nothing but a lot of ghosts anyhow, like
ourselves, and we can pretend we don&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that could be, it would be excellent,&rdquo; said
Morgan; &ldquo;but it is impossible. For a pirate of the Byronic
order, my dear Conrad, you are strangely unversed in the ways of
the sex which cheers but not inebriates. We can no more ignore
their presence upon this boat than we can expect whales to spout
kerosene. In the first place, it would be excessively impolite of
us to cut them&mdash;to decline to speak to them if they should
address us. We may be pirates, ruffians, cutthroats, but I hope we
shall never forget that we are gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole situation is rather contrary to etiquette,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; suggested Conrad.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody to introduce us, and I can&rsquo;t
really see how we can do otherwise than ignore them. I certainly am
not going to stand on deck and make eyes at them, to try and pick
up an acquaintance with them, even if I am of a Byronic
strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; said Kidd, &ldquo;two essential
features of the situation. These women are at present&mdash;or
shortly will be, when they realize their situation&mdash;in
distress, and a true gentleman may always fly to the rescue of a
distressed female; and, the second point, we shall soon be on the
seas, and I understand that on the fashionable transatlantic lines
it is now considered <em>de rigueur</em> to speak to anybody you
choose to. The introduction business isn&rsquo;t going to stand in
my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, may I ask,&rdquo; put in Abeuchapeta, &ldquo;just
what it is that is worrying you? You said something about feeding
them, and dressing them, and keeping them in bonnets. I fancy
there&rsquo;s fish enough in the sea to feed &lsquo;em; and as for
their gowns and hats, they can make &lsquo;em themselves. Every
woman is a milliner at heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, and we&rsquo;ll have to pay the milliners. That
is what bothers me. I was going to lead this expedition to London,
Paris, and New York, admiral. That is where the money is, and to
get it you&rsquo;ve got to go ashore, to headquarters. You cannot
nowadays find it on the high seas. Modern civilization,&rdquo; said
Kidd, &ldquo;has ruined the pirate&rsquo;s business. The latest
news from the other world has really opened my eyes to certain
facts that I never dreamed of. The conditions of the day of which I
speak are interestingly shown in the experience of our friend
Hawkins here. Captain Hawkins, would you have any objection to
stating to these gentlemen the condition of affairs which led you
to give up piracy on the high seas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest, Captain Kidd,&rdquo; returned Captain
Hawkins, who was a recent arrival in Hades. &ldquo;It is a sad
little story, and it gives me a pain for to think on it, but none
the less I&rsquo;ll tell it, since you ask me. When I were a mere
boy, fellow-pirates, I had but one ambition, due to my
readin&rsquo;, which was confined to stories of a Sunday-school
nater&mdash;to become somethin&rsquo; different from the little
Willies an&rsquo; the clever Tommies what I read about therein.
They was all good, an&rsquo; they went to their reward too soon in
life for me, who even in them days regarded death as a stuffy
an&rsquo; unpleasant diversion. Learnin&rsquo; at an early period
that virtue was its only reward, an&rsquo; a-wish-in&rsquo; others,
I says to myself: &lsquo;Jim,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;if you wishes
to become a magnet in this village, be sinful. If so be as you are
a good boy, an&rsquo; kind to your sister an&rsquo; all other
animals, you&rsquo;ll end up as a prosperous father with fifteen
hundred a year sure, with never no hope for no public preferment
beyond bein&rsquo; made the superintendent of the Sunday-school;
but if so be as how you&rsquo;re bad, you may become famous,
an&rsquo; go to Congress, an&rsquo; have your picture in the Sunday
noospapers.&rsquo; So I looks around for books tellin&rsquo; how to
get &lsquo;Famous in Fifty Ways,&rsquo; an&rsquo; after due
reflection I settles in my mind that to be a pirate&rsquo;s just
the thing for me, seein&rsquo; as how it&rsquo;s both profitable
an&rsquo; healthy. Passin&rsquo; over details, let me tell you that
I became a pirate. I ran away to sea, an&rsquo; by dint of
perseverance, as the Sunday-school books useter say, in my badness
I soon became the centre of a evil lot; an&rsquo; when I says to
&lsquo;em, &lsquo;Boys, I wants to be a pirate chief,&rsquo; they
hollers back, loud like, &lsquo;Jim, we&rsquo;re with you,&rsquo;
an&rsquo; they was. For years I was the terror of the Venezuelan
Gulf, the Spanish Main, an&rsquo; the Pacific seas, but there was
precious little money into it. The best pay I got was from a Sunday
noospaper, which paid me well to sign an article on &lsquo;Modern
Piracy&rsquo; which I didn&rsquo;t write. Finally business got so
bad the crew began to murmur, an&rsquo; I was at my wits&rsquo;
ends to please &lsquo;em; when one mornin&rsquo;, havin&rsquo;
passed a restless night, I picks up a noospaper and sees in it that
&lsquo;Next Saturday&rsquo;s steamer is a weritable treasure-ship,
takin&rsquo; out twelve million dollars, and the jewels of a
certain prima donna valued at five hundred thousand.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s my chance,&rsquo; says I, an&rsquo; I goes to
sea and lies in wait for the steamer. I captures her easy, my crew
bein&rsquo; hungry, an&rsquo; fightin&rsquo; according like. We
steals the box a-hold-in&rsquo; the jewels an&rsquo; the bag
containin&rsquo; the millions, hustles back to our own ship,
an&rsquo; makes for our rondyvoo, me with two bullets in my leg,
four o&rsquo; my crew killed, and one engin&rsquo; of my ship
disabled by a shot&mdash;but happy. Twelve an&rsquo; a half
millions at one break is enough to make anybody happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; said Abeuchapeta, with an
ecstatic shake of his head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get that in all
my career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; sighed Kidd. &ldquo;But go on,
Hawkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I says,&rdquo; continued Captain Hawkins,
&ldquo;we goes to the rondyvoo to look over our booty.
&lsquo;Captain &lsquo;Awkins,&rsquo; says my valet&mdash;for I was
a swell pirate, gents, an&rsquo; never travelled nowhere without a
man to keep my clothes brushed and the proper wrinkles in my
trousers&mdash;&lsquo;this &lsquo;ere twelve millions,&rsquo; says
he, &lsquo;is werry light,&rsquo; says he, carryin&rsquo; the bag
ashore. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care how light it is, so long as
it&rsquo;s twelve millions, Henderson,&rsquo; says I; but my heart
sinks inside o&rsquo; me at his words, an&rsquo; the minute we
lands I sits down to investigate right there on the beach. I opens
the bag, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s the one I was after&mdash;but the
twelve millions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; cried Conrad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they was there,&rdquo; sighed Hawkins, &ldquo;but
every bloomin&rsquo; million was represented by a certified check,
an&rsquo; payable in London!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_10.jpg"><img src=

id="illo_10" name="illo_10" width="216" height="187" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;EVERY BLOOMIN&rsquo; MILLION WAS REPRESENTED BY A
CERTIFIED CHECK, AN&rsquo; PAYABLE IN LONDON&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;By Jingo!&rdquo; cried Morgan. &ldquo;What fearful luck!
But you had the prima donna&rsquo;s jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hawkins, with a moan. &ldquo;But they
was like all other prima donna&rsquo;s jewels&mdash;for
advertisin&rsquo; purposes only, an&rsquo; made o&rsquo;
gum-arabic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; said Abeuchapeta. &ldquo;And the crew,
what did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was a crew of a few words,&rdquo; sighed Hawkins.
&ldquo;Werry few words, an&rsquo; not a civil word in the
lot&mdash;mostly adjectives of a profane kind. When I told
&lsquo;em what had happened, they got mad at Fortune for
a-jiltin&rsquo; of &lsquo;em, an&rsquo;&mdash;well, I came here. I
was &rsquo;sas&rsquo;inated that werry night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They killed you?&rdquo; cried Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dozen times,&rdquo; nodded Hawkins. &ldquo;They always
was a lavish lot. I met death in all its most horrid forms. First
they stabbed me, then they shot me, then they clubbed me, and so
on, endin&rsquo; up with a lynchin&rsquo;&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t
mind much after the first, which hurt a bit. But now that I&rsquo;m
here I&rsquo;m glad it happened. This life is sort of less
responsible than that other. You can&rsquo;t hurt a ghost by
shooting him, because there ain&rsquo;t nothing to hurt, an&rsquo;
I must say I like bein&rsquo; a mere vision what everybody can see
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which interesting tale proves what?&rdquo; queried
Abeuchapeta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That piracy on the sea is not profitable in these days of
the check banking system,&rdquo; said Kidd. &ldquo;If you can get a
chance at real gold it&rsquo;s all right, but it&rsquo;s of no
earthly use to steal checks that people can stop payment on.
Therefore it was my plan to visit the cities and do a little
freebooting there, where solid material wealth is to be
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? Can&rsquo;t we do it now?&rdquo; asked
Abeuchapeta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with these women tagging after us,&rdquo; returned
Kidd. &ldquo;If we went to London and lifted the whole Bank of
England, these women would have it spent on Regent Street inside of
twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave them on board,&rdquo; said Abeuchapeta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have them steal the ship!&rdquo; retorted Kidd.
&ldquo;No. There are but two things to do. Take &lsquo;em back, or
land them in Paris. Tell them to spend a week on shore while we are
provisioning. Tell &lsquo;em to shop to their hearts&rsquo;
content, and while they are doing it we can sneak off and leave
them stranded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will they consent?&rdquo; asked Abeuchapeta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consent! To shop? In Paris? For a week?&rdquo; cried
Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Hawkins. &ldquo;Will they consent!
Will a duck swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was decided, which was the first incident in the
career of the House-boat upon which the astute Mr. Sherlock Holmes
had failed to count.</p>
<h3><a name="Ch_VI" id="Ch_VI">VI</a></h3>
<h2>A Conference Below-Stairs</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>When, with a resounding slam, the door to the upper deck of the
House-boat was shut in the faces of queens Elizabeth and Cleopatra
by the unmannerly Kidd, these ladies turned and gazed at those who
thronged the stairs behind them in blank amazement, and the heart
of Xanthippe, had one chosen to gaze through that diaphanous
person&rsquo;s ribs, could have been seen to beat angrily.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth was so excited at this wholly novel attitude
towards her regal self that, having turned, she sat down plump upon
the floor in the most unroyal fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;If this does not
surpass everything! The idea of it! Oh for one hour of my olden
power, one hour of the axe, one hour of the block!&rdquo;</p>

<p>QUEEN ELIZABETH DESIRES AN AXE AND ONE HOUR OF HER OLDEN
POWER</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; retorted Cleopatra, &ldquo;and let us all
return to the billiard-room and discuss this matter calmly. It is
quite evident that something has happened of which we wotted little
when we came aboard this craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good idea,&rdquo; said Calpurnia, retreating
below. &ldquo;I can see through the window that we are in motion.
The vessel has left her moorings, and is making considerable
headway down the stream, and the distinctly masculine voices we
have heard are indications to my mind that the ship is manned, and
that this is the result of design rather than of accident. Let us
below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth rose up and readjusted her ruff, which in the
excitement of the moment had been forced to assume a position about
her forehead which gave one the impression that its royal wearer
had suddenly donned a sombrero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let us below; but oh,
for the axe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the lady an axe,&rdquo; cried Xanthippe,
sarcastically. &ldquo;She wants to cut somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sally was not greeted with applause. The situation was
regarded as being too serious to admit of humor, and in silence
they filed back into the billiard-room, and, arranging themselves
in groups, stood about anxiously discussing the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting rougher every minute,&rdquo; sobbed
Ophelia. &ldquo;Look at those pool-balls!&rdquo; These were in very
truth chasing each other about the table in an extraordinary
fashion. &ldquo;And I wish I&rsquo;d never followed you horrid new
creatures on board!&rdquo; the poor girl added, in an agony of
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;ve crossed the bar already!&rdquo;
said Cleopatra, gazing out of the window at a nasty choppy sea that
was adding somewhat to the disquietude of the fair gathering.
&ldquo;If this is merely a joke on the part of the Associated
Shades, it is a mighty poor one, and I think it is time it should
cease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for an axe!&rdquo; moaned Elizabeth, again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, your Majesty,&rdquo; put in Xanthippe.
&ldquo;You said that before, and I must say it is getting tiresome.
You couldn&rsquo;t do anything with an axe. Suppose you had one.
What earthly good would it do you, who were accustomed to doing all
your killing by proxy? I don&rsquo;t believe, if you had the
unmannerly person who slammed the door in your face lying prostrate
upon the billiard-table here, you could hit him a square blow in
the neck if you had a hundred axes. Delilah might as well cry for
her scissors, for all the good it would do us in our predicament.
If Cleopatra had her asp with her it might be more to the purpose.
One deadly little snake like that let loose on the upper deck would
doubtless drive these boors into the sea, and even then our
condition would not be bettered, for there isn&rsquo;t any of us
that can sail a boat. There isn&rsquo;t an old salt among
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad Mrs. Lot isn&rsquo;t along,&rdquo; giggled
Marguerite de Valois, whose Gallic spirits were by no means
overshadowed by the unhappy predicament in which she found
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; piped up Mrs. Lot. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m not that kind of a salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am present,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;Though why I
ever came I don&rsquo;t know, for I vowed the minute I set my foot
on Ararat that dry land was good enough for me, and that I&rsquo;d
never step aboard another boat as long as I lived. If, however, now
that I am here, I can give you the benefit of my nautical
experience, you are all perfectly welcome to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re very much obliged for the
offer,&rdquo; said Portia, &ldquo;but in the emergency which has
arisen we cannot say how much obliged we are until we know what
your experience amounted to. Before relying upon you we ought to
know how far that reliance can go&mdash;not that I lack confidence
in you, my dear madam, but that in an hour of peril one must take
care to rely upon the oak, not upon the reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point is properly taken,&rdquo; said Elizabeth,
&ldquo;and I wish to say here that I am easier in my mind when I
realize that we have with us so level-headed a person as the lady
who has just spoken. She has spoken truly and to the point. If I
were to become queen again, I should make her my attorney-general.
We must not go ahead impulsively, but look at all things in a calm,
judicial manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is pretty hard work with a sea like this on,&rdquo;
remarked Ophelia, faintly, for she was getting a trifle sallow, as
indeed she might, for the House-boat was beginning to roll
tremendously, with no alleviation save an occasional pitch, which
was an alleviation only in the sense that it gave variety to their
discomfort. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a chief-justice could look
at things calmly and in a judicial manner if he felt as I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear!&rdquo; said the matronly Mrs. Noah,
sympathetically. &ldquo;I know exactly how you feel. I have been
there myself. The fourth day out I and my whole family were in the
same condition, except that Noah, my husband, was so very far gone
that I could not afford to yield. I nursed him for six days before
he got his sea-legs on, and then succumbed myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; gasped Ophelia, &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t
help me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did my husband,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;When he
heard that the boys were sea-sick too, he actually laughed and
began to get better right away. There is really only one cure for
the <em>mal de mer</em>, and that is the fun of knowing that
somebody else is suffering too. If some of you ladies would kindly
yield to the seductions of the sea, I think we could get this poor
girl on her feet in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for poor Ophelia, there was no immediate response
to this appeal, and the unhappy young woman was forced to suffer in
solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no time for untimely diversions of this
sort,&rdquo; snapped Xanthippe, with a scornful glance at the
suffering Ophelia, who, having retired to a comfortable lounge at
an end of the room, was evidently improving. &ldquo;I have no
sympathy with this habit some of my sex seem to have acquired of
succumbing to an immediate sensation of this nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to be pardoned for interrupting,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Noah, with a great deal of firmness, &ldquo;but I wish Mrs.
Socrates to understand that it is rather early in the voyage for
her to lay down any such broad principle as that, and for her own
sake to-morrow, I think it would be well if she withdrew the
sentiment. There are certain things about a sea-voyage that are
more or less beyond the control of man or woman, and any one who
chides that poor suffering child on yonder sofa ought to be more
confident than Mrs. Socrates can possibly be that within an hour
she will not be as badly off. People who live in glass houses
should not throw dice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never yield to anything so undignified as
seasickness, let me tell you that,&rdquo; retorted Xanthippe.
&ldquo;Furthermore, the proverb is not as the lady has quoted it.
&lsquo;People who live in glass houses should not throw
stones&rsquo; is the proper version.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not quoting,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Noah, calmly.
&ldquo;When I said that people who live in glass houses should not
throw dice, I meant precisely what I said. People who live in glass
houses should not take chances. In assuming with such vainglorious
positiveness that she will not be seasick, the lady who has just
spoken is giving tremendous odds, as the boys used to say on the
Ark when we gathered about the table at night and began to make
small wagers on the day&rsquo;s run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better suspend this discussion,&rdquo;
suggested Cleopatra. &ldquo;It is of no immediate interest to any
one but Ophelia, and I fancy she does not care to dwell upon it at
any great length. It is more important that we should decide upon
our future course of action. In the first place, the question is
who these people up on deck are. If they are the members of the
club, we are all right. They will give us our scare, and land us
safely again at the pier. In that event it is our womanly duty to
manifest no concern, and to seem to be aware of nothing unusual in
the proceeding. It would never do to let them think that their joke
has been a good one. If, on the other hand, as I fear, we are the
victims of some horde of ruffians, who have pounced upon us
unawares, and are going into the business of abduction on a
wholesale basis, we must meet treachery with treachery, strategy
with strategy. I, for one, am perfectly willing to make every man
on board walk the plank, having confidence in the seawomanship of
Mrs. Noah and her ability to steer us into port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite in accord with these views,&rdquo; put in
Madame R&eacute;camier, &ldquo;and I move you, Mrs. President, that
we organize a series of subcommittees&mdash;one on treachery, with
Lucretia Borgia and Delilah as members; one on strategy, consisting
of Portia and Queen Elizabeth; one on navigation, headed by Mrs.
Noah; with a final subcommittee on reconnoitre, with Cassandra to
look forward, and Mrs. Lot to look aft&mdash;all of these
subordinated to a central committee of safety headed by Cleopatra
and Calpurnia. The rest of us can then commit ourselves and our
interests unreservedly to these ladies, and proceed to enjoy
ourselves without thought of the morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I second the motion,&rdquo; said Ophelia, &ldquo;with the
amendment that Madame R&eacute;camier be appointed chair-lady of
another subcommittee, on entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amendment was accepted, and the motion put. It was carried
with an enthusiastic aye, and the organization was complete.</p>
<p>The various committees retired to the several corners of the
room to discuss their individual lines of action, when a shadow was
observed to obscure the moonlight which had been streaming in
through the window. The faces of Calpurnia and Cleopatra blanched
for an instant, as, immediately following upon this apparition, a
large bundle was hurled through the open port into the middle of
the room, and the shadow vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a bomb?&rdquo; cried several of the ladies at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Madame R&eacute;camier, jumping
lightly forward. &ldquo;A man doesn&rsquo;t mind blowing a woman
up, but he&rsquo;ll never blow himself up. We&rsquo;re safe enough
in that respect. The thing looks to me like a bundle of illustrated
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; said Cleopatra, who had
been investigating. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a discourteous bit of
courtesy, tossing them in through the window that way, I think, but
I presume they mean well. Dear me,&rdquo; she added, as, having
untied the bundle, she held one of the open papers up before her,
&ldquo;how interesting! All the latest Paris fashions. Humph! Look
at those sleeves, Elizabeth. What an impregnable fortress you would
have been with those sleeves added to your ruffs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think they&rsquo;d be very becoming,&rdquo; put
in Cassandra, standing on her tiptoes and looking over
Cleopatra&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;That Watteau isn&rsquo;t bad,
either, is it, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; remarked Calpurnia. &ldquo;I wonder how a
Watteau back like that would go on my blue alpaca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nicely,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;How many gores
has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five,&rdquo; observed Calpurnia. &ldquo;One more than
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s toga. We had to have our costumes distinct in
some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A remarkable hat, that,&rdquo; nodded Mrs. Lot, her eye
catching sight of a Virot creation at the top of the page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me of Eve&rsquo;s description of an autumn scene
in the garden,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;Gorgeous in its
foliage, beautiful thing; though I shouldn&rsquo;t have dared wear
one in the Ark, with all those hungry animals browsing about the
upper and lower decks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; remarked Cleopatra, as she cocked her
head to one side to take in the full effect of an attractive summer
gown&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder how that waist would make up in blue
cr&eacute;pon, with a yoke of lace and a stylishly contrasting
stock of satin ribbon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would depend upon how you finished the sleeves,&rdquo;
remarked Madame R&eacute;camier. &ldquo;If you had a few puffs of
rich brocaded satin set in with deeply folded pleats it
wouldn&rsquo;t be bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be very effective,&rdquo; observed Mrs.
Noah, &ldquo;but a trifle too light for general wear. I should want
some kind of a wrap with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does need that,&rdquo; assented Elizabeth. &ldquo;A
wrap made of passementerie and jet, with a mousseline de soie ruche
about the neck held by a <em>chou</em>, would make it
fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The committee on treachery is ready to report,&rdquo;
said Delilah, rising from her corner, where she and Lucretia Borgia
had been having so animated a discussion that they had failed to
observe the others crowding about Cleopatra and the papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;THE COMMITTEE ON TREACHERY IS READY TO
REPORT&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little sombre,&rdquo; said Cleopatra. &ldquo;The
corsage is effective, but I don&rsquo;t like those basque
terminations. I&rsquo;ve never approved of those full
godets&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The committee on treachery,&rdquo; remarked Delilah
again, raising her voice, &ldquo;has a suggestion to
make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get over those sleeves, though,&rdquo;
laughed Helen of Troy. &ldquo;What is the use of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might be used to get Greeks into Troy,&rdquo;
suggested Madame R&eacute;camier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The committee on treachery,&rdquo; roared Delilah,
thoroughly angered by the absorption of the chairman and others,
&ldquo;has a suggestion to make. This is the third and last
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg pardon,&rdquo; cried Cleopatra, rapping for
order. &ldquo;I had forgotten all about our committees. Excuse me,
Delilah. I&mdash;ah&mdash;was absorbed in other matters. Will you
kindly lay your pattern&mdash;I should say your plan&mdash;before
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is briefly this,&rdquo; said Delilah. &ldquo;It has
been suggested that we invite the crew of this vessel to a
chafing-dish party, under the supervision of Lucretia Borgia, and
that she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The balance of the plan was not outlined, for at this point the
speaker was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door, its instant
opening, and the appearance in the doorway of that ill-visaged
ruffian Captain Kidd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have come here to
explain to you the situation in which you find yourselves. Have I
your permission to speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies started back, but the chairman was equal to the
occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Cleopatra, with queenly dignity,
turning to the interloper; and the pirate proceeded to take the
second step in the nefarious plan upon which he and his brother
ruffians had agreed, of which the tossing in through the window of
the bundle of fashion papers was the first.</p>
<h3><a name="Ch_VII" id="Ch_VII">VII</a></h3>
<h2>The &ldquo;Gehenna&rdquo; is Chartered</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>It was about twenty-four hours after the events narrated in the
preceding chapters that Mr. Sherlock Holmes assumed command of the
<em>Gehenna</em>, which was nothing more nor less than the shadow
of the ill-starred ocean steamship <em>City of Chicago</em>, which
tried some years ago to reach Liverpool by taking the overland
route through Ireland, fortunately without detriment to her
passengers or crew, who had the pleasure of the experience of
shipwreck without any of the discomforts of drowning. As will be
remembered, the obstructionist nature of the Irish soil prevented
the <em>City of Chicago</em> from proceeding farther inland than
was necessary to keep her well balanced amidships upon a convenient
and not too stony bed; and that after a brief sojourn on the rocks
she was finally disposed of to the Styx Navigation Company, under
which title Charon had had himself incorporated, is a matter of
nautical history. The change of name to the <em>Gehenna</em> was
the act of Charon himself, and was prompted, no doubt, by a desire
to soften the jealous prejudices of the residents of the Stygian
capital against the flourishing and ever-growing metropolis of
Illinois.</p>
<p>The Associated Shades had had some trouble in getting this
craft. Charon, through his constant association with life on both
sides of the dark river, had gained a knowledge, more or less
intimate, of modern business methods, and while as janitor of the
club he was subject to the will of the House Committee, and
sympathized deeply with the members of the association in their
trouble, as president of the Styx Navigation Company he was bound
up in certain newly attained commercial ideas which were
embarrassing to those members of the association to whose hands the
chartering of a vessel had been committed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Charon,&rdquo; Sir Walter Raleigh had said,
after Charon had expressed himself as deeply sympathetic, but
unable to shave the terms upon which the vessel could be had,
&ldquo;you are an infernal old hypocrite. You go about wringing
your hands over our misfortunes until they&rsquo;ve got as dry and
flabby as a pair of kid gloves, and yet when we ask you for a ship
of suitable size and speed to go out after those pirates, you
become a sort of twin brother to Shylock, without his excuse. His
instincts are accidents of birth. Yours are cultivated, and you
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very much mistaken, Sir Walter,&rdquo; Charon had
answered to this. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand my position. It
is a very hard one. As janitor of your club I am really prostrated
over the events of the past twenty-four hours. My occupation is
gone, and my despair over your loss is correspondingly greater, for
I have time on my hands to brood over it. I was hysterical as a
woman yesterday afternoon&mdash;so hysterical that I came near
upsetting one of the Furies who engaged me to row her down to
Madame Medusa&rsquo;s villa last evening; and right at the sluice
of the vitriol reservoir at that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_13.jpg"><img src=

id="illo_13" name="illo_13" width="174" height="216" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN, SIR
WALTER&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why the deuce don&rsquo;t you do something to help
us?&rdquo; pleaded Hamlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I do any more than I have done? I&rsquo;ve
offered you the <em>Gehenna</em>,&rdquo; retorted Charon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But on what terms?&rdquo; expostulated Raleigh. &ldquo;If
we had all the wealth of the Indies we&rsquo;d have difficulty in
paying you the sums you demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am only president of the company,&rdquo; explained
Charon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like, as president, to show you some
courtesy, and I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to do so; but when it
comes down to giving you a vessel like that, I&rsquo;m bound by my
official oath to consider the interest of the stockholders. It
isn&rsquo;t as it used to be when I had boats to hire in my own
behalf alone. In those days I had nobody&rsquo;s interest but my
own to look after. Now the ships all belong to the Styx Navigation
Company. Can&rsquo;t you see the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You own all the stock, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; insisted
Raleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Charon answered, blandly.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the transfer-books lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know that you did own every share of it, and that
you haven&rsquo;t sold any, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; put in
Hamlet.</p>
<p>Charon was puzzled for a moment, but shortly his face cleared,
and Sir Walter&rsquo;s heart sank, for it was evident that the old
fellow could not be cornered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way, Sir Walter, and your
Highness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say whether
any of that stock has been transferred or not. The fact is,
I&rsquo;ve been speculating a little on margin, and I&rsquo;ve put
up that stock as security, and, for all I know, I may have been
sold out by my brokers. I&rsquo;ve been so upset by this
unfortunate occurrence that I haven&rsquo;t seen the market reports
for two days. Really you&rsquo;ll have to be content with my offer
or go without the <em>Gehenna</em>. There&rsquo;s too much
suspicion attached to high corporate officials lately for me to
yield a jot in the position I have taken. It would never do to get
you all ready to start, and then have an injunction clapped on you
by some unforeseen stockholder who was not satisfied with the terms
offered you; nor can I ever let it be said of me that to retain my
position as janitor of your organization I sacrificed a trust
committed to my charge. I&rsquo;ll gladly lend you my private
launch, though I don&rsquo;t think it will aid you much, because
the naphtha-tank has exploded, and the screw slipped off and went
to the bottom two weeks ago. Still, it is at your service, and
I&rsquo;ve no doubt that either Phidias or Benvenuto Cellini will
carve out a paddle for you if you ask him to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; retorted Raleigh. &ldquo;You might as well
offer us a pair of skates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, if I thought the river&rsquo;d freeze,&rdquo;
retorted Charon, blandly.</p>
<p>Raleigh and Hamlet turned away impatiently and left Charon to
his own devices, which for the time being consisted largely of
winking his other eye quietly and outwardly making a great show of
grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too canny for us, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Sir
Walter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to pay him his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us first consult Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; suggested
Hamlet, and this they proceeded at once to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one thing to be done,&rdquo; observed the
astute detective after he had heard Sir Walter&rsquo;s statement of
the case. &ldquo;It is an old saying that one should fight fire
with fire. We must meet modern business methods with modern
commercial ideas. Charter his vessel at his own price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;d never be able to pay,&rdquo; said
Hamlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha-ha!&rdquo; laughed Holmes. &ldquo;It is evident that
you know nothing of the laws of trade nowadays. Don&rsquo;t
pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we?&rdquo; asked Raleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The method is simple. You haven&rsquo;t anything to pay
with,&rdquo; returned Holmes. &ldquo;Let him sue. Suppose he gets a
verdict. You haven&rsquo;t anything he can attach&mdash;if you
have, make it over to your wives or your
fianc&eacute;es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that honest?&rdquo; asked Hamlet, shaking his head
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; said Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose he wants an advance payment?&rdquo; queried
Hamlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him a check drawn to his own order. He&rsquo;ll have
to endorse it when he deposits it, and that will make him
responsible,&rdquo; laughed Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a simple thing when you understand it!&rdquo;
commented Raleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;Business is getting by
slow degrees to be an exact science. It reminds me of the Brighton
mystery, in which I played a modest part some ten years ago, when I
first took up ferreting as a profession. I was sitting one night in
my room at one of the Brighton hotels, which shall be nameless. I
never give the name of any of the hotels at which I stop, because
it might give offence to the proprietors of other hotels, with the
result that my books would be excluded from sale therein. Suffice
it to say that I was spending an early summer Sunday at Brighton
with my friend Watson. We had dined well, and were enjoying our
evening smoke together upon a small balcony overlooking the water,
when there came a timid knock on the door of my room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Watson,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;here comes some one
for advice. Do you wish to wager a small bottle upon it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, with a smile. &lsquo;I am
thirsty and I&rsquo;d like a small bottle; and while I do not
expect to win, I&rsquo;ll take the bet. I should like to know,
though, how you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is quite simple,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;The
timidity of the knock shows that my visitor is one of two classes
of persons&mdash;an autograph-hunter or a client, one of the two.
You see I give you a chance to win. It may be an autograph-hunter,
but I think it is a client. If it were a creditor, he would knock
boldly, even ostentatiously; if it were the maid, she would not
knock at all; if it were the hall-boy, he would not come until I
had rung five times for him. None of these things has occurred; the
knock is the half-hearted knock which betokens either that the
person who knocked is in trouble, or is uncertain as to his
reception. I am willing, however, considering the heat and my
desire to quench my thirst, to wager that it is a
client.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Done,&rsquo; said Watson; and I immediately
remarked, &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door opened, and a man of about thirty-five years of
age, in a bathing-suit, entered the room, and I saw at a glance
what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your name is Burgess,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You
came here from London this morning, expecting to return to-night.
You brought no luggage with you. After luncheon you went in
bathing. You had machine No. 35, and when you came out of the water
you found that No. 35 had disappeared, with your clothes and the
silver watch your uncle gave you on the day you succeeded to his
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, gentlemen,&rdquo; observed the detective, with
a smile at Sir Walter and Hamlet&mdash;&ldquo;of course the man
fairly gasped, and I continued: &lsquo;You have been lying face
downward in the sand ever since, waiting for nightfall, so that you
could come to me for assistance, not considering it good form to
make an afternoon call upon a stranger at his hotel, clad in a
bathing-suit. Am I correct?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; he replied, with a look of wonder,
&lsquo;you have narrated my story exactly as it happened, and I
find I have made no mistake in coming to you. Would you mind
telling me what is your course of reasoning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is plain as day,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;I am the
person with the red beard with whom you came down third class from
London this morning, and you told me your name was Burgess and that
you were a butcher. When you looked to see the time, I remarked
upon the oddness of your watch, which led to your telling me that
it was the gift of your uncle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Burgess, &lsquo;but I did not
tell you I had no luggage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but that you
hadn&rsquo;t is plain; for if you had brought any other clothing
besides that you had on with you, you would have put it on to come
here. That you have been robbed I deduce also from your
costume.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But the number of the machine?&rsquo; asked
Watson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is on the tag on the key hanging about his
neck,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One more question,&rsquo; queried Burgess.
&lsquo;How do you know I have been lying face downward on the beach
ever since?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By the sand in your eyebrows,&rsquo; I replied;
and Watson ordered up the small bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fail to see what it was in our conversation,
however,&rdquo; observed Hamlet, somewhat impatient over the delay
caused by the narration of this tale, &ldquo;that suggested this
train of thought to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sequel will show,&rdquo; returned Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; put in Raleigh. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we
put off the sequel until a later issue? Remember, Mr. Holmes, that
we are constantly losing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sequel is brief, and I can narrate it on our way to
the office of the Navigation Company,&rdquo; observed the
detective. &ldquo;When the bottle came I invited Mr. Burgess to
join us, which he did, and as the hour was late when we came to
separate, I offered him the use of my parlor overnight. This he
accepted, and we retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning when I arose to dress, the mystery was
cleared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had dreamed its solution?&rdquo; asked Raleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Holmes. &ldquo;Burgess had disappeared
with all my clothing, my false-beard, my suit-case, and my watch.
The only thing he had left me was the bathing-suit and a few empty
small bottles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, may I ask,&rdquo; put in Hamlet, as they drew
near to Charon&rsquo;s office&mdash;&ldquo;why does that case
remind you of business as it is conducted to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this, that it is a good thing to stay out of unless
you know it all,&rdquo; explained Holmes. &ldquo;I omitted in the
case of Burgess to observe one thing about him. Had I observed that
his nose was rectilinear, incurved, and with a lifted base, and
that his auricular temporal angle was between 96 and 97 degrees, I
should have known at once that he was an impostor. <em>Vide</em>
Ottolenghui on &lsquo;Ears and Noses I Have Met,&rsquo; pp.
631-640.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you can tell a criminal by his
ears?&rdquo; demanded Hamlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has any&mdash;yes; but I did not know that at the
time of the Brighton mystery. Therefore I should have stayed out of
the case. But here we are. Good-morning, Charon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the trio had entered the private office of the
president of the Styx Navigation Company, and in a few moments the
vessel was chartered at a fabulous price.</p>
<p>On the return to the wharf, Sir Walter somewhat nervously asked
Holmes if he thought the plan they had settled upon would work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charon is a very shrewd old fellow,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;He may outwit us yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are just two and one-eighth degrees in your
favor,&rdquo; observed Holmes, quietly, with a glance at
Raleigh&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;The temporal angle of your ears is
93-1/8 degrees, whereas Charon&rsquo;s stand out at 91, by my
otometer. To that extent your criminal instincts are superior to
his. If criminology is an exact science, reasoning by your
respective ears, you ought to beat him out by a perceptible though
possibly narrow margin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which assurance Raleigh went ahead with his preparations,
and within twelve hours the <em>Gehenna</em> was under way,
carrying a full complement of crew and officers, with every
state-room on board occupied by some spirit of the more illustrious
kind.</p>
<p>Even Shylock was on board, though no one knew it, for in the
dead of night he had stolen quietly up the gang-plank and had
hidden himself in an empty water-cask in the forecastle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t Venice,&rdquo; he said, as he sat
down and breathed heavily through the bung of the barrel,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s musty and damp enough, and, considering the
cost, I can&rsquo;t complain. You can&rsquo;t get something for
nothing, even in Hades.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>On Board the &ldquo;Gehenna&rdquo;</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>When the <em>Gehenna</em> had passed down the Styx and out
through the beautiful Cimmerian Harbor into the broad waters of the
ocean, and everything was comparatively safe for a while at least,
Sherlock Holmes came down from the bridge, where he had taken his
place as the commander of the expedition at the moment of
departure. His brow was furrowed with anxiety, and through his
massive forehead his brain could be seen to be throbbing violently,
and the corrugations of his gray matter were not pleasant to
witness as he tried vainly to squeeze an idea out of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Demosthenes, anxiously.
&ldquo;We are not in any danger, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Holmes. &ldquo;But I am somewhat
puzzled at the bubbles on the surface of the ocean, and the ripples
which we passed over an hour or two ago, barely perceptible through
the most powerful microscope, indicate to my mind that for some
reason at present unknown to me the House-boat has changed her
course. Take that bubble floating by. It is the last expiring bit
of aerial agitation of the House-boat&rsquo;s wake. Observe whence
it comes. Not from the Azores quarter, but as if instead of
steering a straight course thither the House-boat had taken a sharp
turn to the northeast, and was making for Havre; or, in other
words, Paris instead of London seems to have become their
destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Demosthenes looked at Holmes with blank amazement, and, to keep
from stammering out the exclamation of wonder that rose to his
lips, he opened his <em>bonbonni&egrave;re</em> and swallowed a
pebble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to have a cocaine tablet in your
box, do you?&rdquo; queried Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the Greek. &ldquo;Cocaine makes me
flighty and nervous, but these pebbles sort of ballast me and hold
me down. How on earth do you know that that bubble comes from the
wake of the House-boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my chemical knowledge, merely,&rdquo; replied Holmes.
&ldquo;A merely worldly vessel leaves a phosphorescent bubble in
its wake. That one we have just discovered is not so, but
sulphurescent, if I may coin a word which it seems to me the
English language is very much in need of. It proves, then, that the
bubble is a portion of the wake of a Stygian craft, and the only
Stygian craft that has cleared the Cimmerian Harbor for years is
the House-boat&mdash;Q.E.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go back until we find the ripple again, and follow
that, I presume,&rdquo; sneered Le Coq, who did not take much stock
in the theories of his great rival, largely because he was a
detective by intuition rather than by study of the science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can if you want to, but it is better not to,&rdquo;
rejoined Holmes, simply, as though not observing the sneer,
&ldquo;because the ripple represents the outer lines of the angle
of disturbance in the water; and as any one of the sides to an
angle is greater than the perpendicular from the hypothenuse to the
apex, you&rsquo;d merely be going the long way. This is especially
important when you consider the formation of the bow of the
House-boat, which is rounded like the stern of most vessels, and
comes near to making a pair of ripples at an angle of ninety
degrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; observed Sir Walter, with a sigh of
disappointment, &ldquo;we must change our course and sail for
Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; said Holmes; &ldquo;but of course
it&rsquo;s by no means certain as yet. I think if Columbus would go
up into the mizzentop and look about him, he might discover
something either in confirmation or refutation of the
theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t discover anything,&rdquo; put in
Pinzon. &ldquo;He never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; retorted Columbus.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know who discovered America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; observed Leif Ericson, with a wink at
Vespucci.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; retorted Columbus. &ldquo;I did it, and the
world knows it, whether you claim it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just as Noah discovered Ararat,&rdquo; replied
Pinzon. &ldquo;You sat upon the deck until we ran plumb into an
island, after floating about for three months, and then you
couldn&rsquo;t tell it from a continent, even when you had it right
before your eyes. Noah might just as well have told his family that
he discovered a roof garden as for you to go back to Spain telling
&lsquo;em all that San Salvador was the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Columbus, with a
short laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one they celebrate, so
what&rsquo;s the odds? I&rsquo;d rather stay down here in the
smoking-room enjoying a small game, anyhow, than climb up that mast
and strain my eyes for ten or a dozen hours looking for evidence to
prove or disprove the correctness of another man&rsquo;s theory. I
wouldn&rsquo;t know evidence when I saw it, anyhow. Send Judge
Blackstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I draw the line at the mizzentop,&rdquo; observed
Blackstone. &ldquo;The dignity of the bench must and shall be
preserved, and I&rsquo;ll never consent to climb up that rigging,
getting pitch and paint on my ermine, no matter who asks me to
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>JUDGE BLACKSTONE REFUSES TO CLIMB TO THE MIZZENTOP</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whomsoever I tell to go, shall go,&rdquo; put in Holmes,
firmly. &ldquo;I am commander of this ship. It will pay you to
remember that, Judge Blackstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am the Court of Appeals,&rdquo; retorted
Blackstone, hotly. &ldquo;Bear that in mind, captain, when you try
to send me up. I&rsquo;ll issue a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> on
my own body, and commit you for contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use of sending the Judge, anyhow,&rdquo;
said Raleigh, fearing by the glitter that came into the eye of the
commander that trouble might ensue unless pacificatory measures
were resorted to. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s accustomed to weighing
everything carefully, and cannot be rushed into a decision. If he
saw any evidence, he&rsquo;d have to sit on it a week before
reaching a conclusion. What we need here more than anything else is
an expert seaman, a lookout, and I nominate Shem. He has sailed
under his father, and I have it on good authority that he is a
nautical expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holmes hesitated for an instant. He was considering the
necessity of disciplining the recalcitrant Blackstone, but he
finally yielded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shem be it.
Bo&rsquo;sun, pipe Shem on deck, and tell him that general order
number one requires him to report at the mizzentop right away, and
that immediately he sees anything he shall come below and make it
known to me. As for the rest of us, having a very considerable
appetite, I do now decree that it is dinner-time. Shall we go
below?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_16.jpg"><img src=

<p>SHEM IN THE LOOKOUT</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I care for any, thank you,&rdquo;
said Raleigh. &ldquo;Fact is&mdash;ah&mdash;I dined last week, and
am not hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noah laughed. &ldquo;Oh, come below and watch us eat,
then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no reply. Raleigh had plunged head first into his
state-room, which fortunately happened to be on the upper deck. The
rest of the spirits repaired below to the saloon, where they were
soon engaged in an animated discussion of such viands as the larder
provided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, from the head of the
table, &ldquo;is what I call comfort. I don&rsquo;t know that I am
so anxious to recover the House-boat, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;with a ship like this
to go off cruising on, and with such a larder. Look at the
thickness of that puree, Doctor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Boswell, faintly, &ldquo;but
I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve left my note-bub-book upstairs, Doctor, and
I&rsquo;d like to go up and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson. &ldquo;I judge from
your color, which is highly suggestive of a modern magazine poster,
that it might be well too if you stayed on deck for a little while
and made a few entries in your commonplace book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Boswell, gratefully. &ldquo;Shall
you say anything clever during dinner, sir? If so, I might be
putting it down while I&rsquo;m up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; roared the Doctor. &ldquo;Get up as high
as you can&mdash;get up with Shem on the
mizzentop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; replied Boswell, and he was
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be more lenient with him, Doctor,&rdquo;
said Bonaparte; &ldquo;he means well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; observed Johnson; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s
so very previous. Last winter, at Chaucer&rsquo;s dinner to Burns,
I made a speech, which Boswell printed a week before it was
delivered, with the words &lsquo;laughter&rsquo; and
&lsquo;uproarious applause&rsquo; interspersed through it. It
placed me in a false position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he know what you were going to say?&rdquo;
queried Demosthenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Johnson. &ldquo;Kind of
mind-reader, I fancy,&rdquo; he added, blushing a trifle.
&ldquo;But, Captain Holmes, what do you deduce from your
observation of the wake of the House-boat? If she&rsquo;s going to
Paris, why the change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two theories,&rdquo; replied the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is always safe,&rdquo; said Le Coq.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always; it doubles your chances of success,&rdquo;
acquiesced Holmes. &ldquo;Anyhow, it gives you a choice, which
makes it more interesting. The change of her course from Londonward
to Parisward proves to me either that Kidd is not satisfied with
the extent of the revenge he has already taken, and wishes to ruin
you gentlemen financially by turning your wives, daughters, and
sisters loose on the Parisian shops, or that the pirates have
themselves been overthrown by the ladies, who have decided to
prolong their cruise and get some fun out of their
misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where else than to Paris would any one in search of
pleasure go?&rdquo; asked Bonaparte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had more fun a few miles outside of Brussels,&rdquo;
said Wellington, with a sly wink at Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let up on that!&rdquo; retorted Bonaparte. &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t you beat me at Waterloo. You couldn&rsquo;t have
beaten me at a plain ordinary game of old-maid with a stacked pack
of cards, much less in the game of war, if you hadn&rsquo;t had the
elements with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; snapped Wellington. &ldquo;It was clear
science laid you out, Boney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taisey-voo!&rdquo; shouted the irate Corsican.
&ldquo;Clear science be hanged! Wet science was what did it. If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for the rain, my little Duke, I should have been
in London within a week, my grenadiers would have been camping in
your Rue Peekadeely, and the Old Guard all over everywhere
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have had a gay army, then,&rdquo; laughed
C&aelig;sar. &ldquo;What are French soldiers made of, that they
can&rsquo;t stand the wet&mdash;unshrunk linen or
flannel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; observed Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders
and walking a few paces away. &ldquo;You do not understand the
French. The Frenchman is not a pell-mell soldier like you Romans;
he is the poet of arms; he does not go in for glory at the expense
of his dignity; style, form, is dearer to him than honor, and he
has no use for fighting in the wet and coming out of the fight
conspicuous as a victor with the curl out of his feathers and his
epaulets rusted with the damp. There is no glory in water. But if
we had had umbrellas and mackintoshes, as every Englishman who
comes to the Continent always has, and a bath-tub for everybody,
then would your Waterloo have been different again, and the great
democracy of Europe with a Bonaparte for emperor would have been
founded for what the Americans call the keeps; and as for your
little Great Britain, ha! she would have become the
Blackwell&rsquo;s Island of the Greater France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost as funny as <em>Punch</em>
isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; drawled Wellington, with an angry gesture at
Bonaparte. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t within telephoning distance of
victory all day. We simply played with you, my boy. It was a
regular game of golf for us. We let you keep up pretty close and
win a few holes, but on the home drive we had you beaten in one
stroke. Go to, my dear Bonaparte, and stop talking about the
flood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lucky thing for us that Noah wasn&rsquo;t a
Frenchman, eh?&rdquo; said Frederick the Great. &ldquo;How that
rain would have fazed him if he had been! The human race would have
been wiped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; ejaculated Noah, deprecating the
unseemliness of the quarrel, and putting his arm affectionately
about Bonaparte&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;When you come down to
that, I was French&mdash;as French as one could be in those
days&mdash;and these Gallic subjects of my friend here were, every
one of &lsquo;em, my lineal descendants, and their hatred of rain
was inherited directly from me, their ancestor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are not we English as much your descendants?&rdquo;
queried Wellington, arching his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said Noah, &ldquo;but you take after Mrs.
Noah more than after me. Water never fazes a woman, and your
delight in tubs is an essentially feminine trait. The first thing
Mrs. Noah carried aboard was a laundry outfit, and then she went
back for rugs and coats and all sorts of hand-baggage. Gad, it
makes me laugh to this day when I think of it! She looked for all
the world like an Englishman travelling on the Continent as she
walked up the gang-plank behind the elephants, each elephant with a
Gladstone bag in his trunk and a hat-box tied to his tail.&rdquo;
Here the venerable old weather-prophet winked at Munchausen, and
the little quarrel which had been imminent passed off in a general
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Boswell? He ought to get that
anecdote,&rdquo; said Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve locked him up in the library,&rdquo; said
Holmes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in charge of the log, and as I have a
pretty good general idea as to what is about to happen, I have
mapped out a skeleton of the plot and set him to work writing it
up.&rdquo; Here the detective gave a sudden start, placed his hand
to his ear, listened intently for an instant, and, taking out his
watch and glancing at it, added, quietly, &ldquo;In three minutes
Shem will be in here to announce a discovery, and one of great
importance, I judge, from the squeak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assemblage gazed earnestly at Holmes for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The squeak?&rdquo; queried Raleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Holmes. &ldquo;The squeak is what
I said, and as I always say what I mean, it follows logically that
I meant what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard no squeak,&rdquo; observed Dr. Johnson;
&ldquo;and, furthermore, I fail to see how a squeak, if I had heard
it, would have portended a discovery of importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not&mdash;to you,&rdquo; said Holmes; &ldquo;but
with me it is different. My hearing is unusually acute. I can hear
the dropping of a pin through a stone wall ten feet thick; any
sound within a mile of my eardrum vibrates thereon with an
intensity which would surprise you, and it is by the use of cocaine
that I have acquired this wonderfully acute sense. A property which
dulls the senses of most people renders mine doubly apprehensive;
therefore, gentlemen, while to you there was no auricular
disturbance, to me there was. I heard Shem sliding down the mast a
minute since. The fact that he slid down the mast instead of
climbing down the rigging showed that he was in great haste,
therefore he must have something to communicate of great
importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t he here already, then? It wouldn&rsquo;t
take him two minutes to get from the deck here,&rdquo; asked the
ever-suspicious Le Coq.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is simple,&rdquo; returned Holmes, calmly. &ldquo;If
you will go yourself and slide down that mast you will see. Shem
has stopped for a little witch-hazel to soothe his burns. It is no
cool matter sliding down a mast two hundred feet in
height.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Sherlock Holmes spoke the door burst open and Shem rushed
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A signal of distress, captain!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what quarter&mdash;to larboard?&rdquo; asked
Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Shem, breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be dead ahead,&rdquo; said Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not to starboard?&rdquo; asked Le Coq, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Holmes, confidently, &ldquo;it
never happens so. If you had ever read a truly exciting sea-tale,
my dear Le Coq, you would have known that interesting things, and
particularly signals of distress, are never seen except to larboard
or dead ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of applause greeted this retort, and Le Coq
subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nature of the signal?&rdquo; demanded Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A black flag, skull and cross-bones down, at
half-mast!&rdquo; cried Shem, &ldquo;and on a rock-bound
coast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re marooned, by heavens!&rdquo; shouted
Holmes, springing to his feet and rushing to the deck, where he was
joined immediately by Sir Walter, Dr. Johnson, Bonaparte, and the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a daisy?&rdquo; whispered Demosthenes to
Diogenes as they climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is more than that; he&rsquo;s a blooming
orchid,&rdquo; said Diogenes, with intense enthusiasm. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ll get my X-ray lantern and see if he&rsquo;s
honest.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Captain Kidd Meets with an Obstacle</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, your Majesty,&rdquo; remarked Helen of Troy as
Cleopatra accorded permission to Captain Kidd to speak, &ldquo;I
have not been introduced to this gentleman nor has he been
presented to me, and I really cannot consent to any proceeding so
irregular as this. I do not speak to gentlemen I have not met, nor
do I permit them to address me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried Xanthippe. &ldquo;I quite agree
with the principle of my young friend from Troy. It may be that
when we claimed for ourselves all the rights of men that the right
to speak and be spoken to by other men without an introduction was
included in the list, but I for one have no desire to avail myself
of the privilege, especially when it&rsquo;s a horrid-looking man
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kidd bowed politely, and smiled so terribly that several of the
ladies fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will withdraw,&rdquo; he said, turning to Cleopatra;
and it must be said that his suggestion was prompted by his
heartfelt wish, for now that he found himself thus conspicuously
brought before so many women, with falsehood on his lips, his
courage began to ooze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, please,&rdquo; answered the chair-lady. &ldquo;I
imagine we can get about this difficulty without much
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it a perfectly proper objection too,&rdquo;
observed Delilah, rising. &ldquo;If we ever needed etiquette we
need it now. But I have a plan which will obviate any further
difficulty. If there is no one among us who is sufficiently well
acquainted with the gentleman to present him formally to us, I will
for the time being take upon myself the office of ship&rsquo;s
barber and cut his hair. I understand that it is quite the proper
thing for barbers to talk, while cutting their hair, to persons to
whom they have not been introduced. And, besides, he really needs a
hair-cut badly. Thus I shall establish an acquaintance with the
captain, after which I can with propriety introduce him to the rest
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the gentleman himself might object to
that,&rdquo; put in Queen Elizabeth. &ldquo;If I remember rightly,
your last customer was very much dissatisfied with the trim you
gave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be unnecessary to do what Delilah
proposes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah, with a kindly smile, as she rose
up from the corner in which she had been sitting, an interested
listener. &ldquo;I can introduce the gentleman to you all with
perfect propriety. He&rsquo;s a member of my family. His
grandfather was the great-grandson a thousand and eight times
removed of my son Shem&rsquo;s great-grandnephew on his
father&rsquo;s side. His relationship to me is therefore obvious,
though from what I know of his reputation I think he takes more
after my husband&rsquo;s ancestors than my own. Willie, dear, these
ladies are friends of mine. Ladies, this young man is one of my
most famous descendants. He has been a man of many adventures, and
he has been hanged once, which, far from making him undesirable as
an acquaintance, has served merely to render him harmless, and
therefore a safe person to know. Now, my son, go ahead and speak
your piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good old spirit sat down, and the scruples of the objectors
having thus been satisfied, Captain Kidd began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I know you all,&rdquo; he remarked, as
pleasantly as he could under the circumstances, &ldquo;I feel that
I can speak more freely, and certainly with a great deal less
embarrassment than if I were addressing a gathering of entire
strangers. I am not much of a hand at speaking, and have always
felt somewhat nonplussed at finding myself in a position of this
nature. In my whole career I never experienced but one irresistible
impulse to make a public address of any length, and that was upon
that unhappy occasion to which the greatest and grandest of my
great-grandmothers has alluded, and that only as the chain by which
I was suspended in mid-air tightened about my vocal chords. At that
moment I could have talked impromptu for a year, so fast and
numerously did thoughts of the uttermost import surge upward into
my brain; but circumstances over which I had no control prevented
the utterance of those thoughts, and that speech is therefore lost
to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has the gift of continuity,&rdquo; observed Madame
R&eacute;camier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to be in the United States Senate,&rdquo; smiled
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could make up my mind as to whether he is
outrageously handsome or desperately ugly,&rdquo; remarked Helen of
Troy. &ldquo;He fascinates me, but whether it is the fascination of
liking or of horror I can&rsquo;t tell, and it&rsquo;s quite
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; resumed the captain, his uneasiness
increasing as he came to the point, &ldquo;I am but the agent of
your respective husbands, <em>fianc&eacute;s</em>, and other
masculine guardians. The gentlemen who were previously the tenants
of this club-house have delegated to me the important, and I may
add highly agreeable, task of showing you the world. They have
noted of late years the growth of that feeling of unrest which is
becoming every day more and more conspicuous in feminine circles in
all parts of the universe&mdash;on the earth, where women are
clamoring to vote, and to be allowed to go out late at night
without an escort; in Hades, where, as you are no doubt aware, the
management of the government has fallen almost wholly into the
hands of the Furies; and even in the halls of Jupiter himself,
where, I am credibly informed, Juno has been taking private lessons
in the art of hurling thunderbolts&mdash;information which the
extraordinary quality of recent electrical storms on the earth
would seem to confirm. Thunderbolts of late years have been cast
hither and yon in a most erratic fashion, striking where they were
least expected, as those of you who keep in touch with the outer
world must be fully aware. Now, actuated by their usual broad and
liberal motives, the men of Hades wish to meet the views of you
ladies to just that extent that your views are based upon a wise
selection, in turn based upon experience, and they have come to me
and in so many words have said, &lsquo;Mr. Kidd, we wish the women
of Hades to see the world. We want them to be satisfied. We do not
like this constantly increasing spirit of unrest. We, who have seen
all the life that we care to see, do not ourselves feel equal to
the task of showing them about. We will pay you liberally if you
will take our House-boat, which they have always been anxious to
enter, and personally conduct our beloved ones to Paris, London,
and elsewhere. Let them see as much of life as they can stand.
Accord them every privilege. Spare no expense; only bring them back
again to us safe and sound.&rsquo; These were their words, ladies.
I asked them why they didn&rsquo;t come along themselves, saying
that even if they were tired of it all, they should make some
personal sacrifice to your comfort; and they answered, reasonably
and well, that they would be only too glad to do so, but that they
feared they might unconsciously seem to exert a repressing
influence upon you. &lsquo;We want them to feel absolutely free,
Captain Kidd,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;and if we are along they may
not feel so.&rsquo; The answer was convincing, ladies, and I
accepted the commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we knew nothing of all this,&rdquo; interposed
Elizabeth. &ldquo;The subject was not broached to us by our
husbands, brothers, <em>fianc&eacute;s</em>, or fathers. My
brother, Sir Walter Raleigh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleopatra chuckled. &ldquo;Brother! Brother&rsquo;s good,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what he is,&rdquo; retorted Elizabeth,
quickly. &ldquo;I promised to be a sister to him, and I&rsquo;m
going to keep my word. That&rsquo;s the kind of a queen I am. I was
about to remark,&rdquo; Elizabeth added, turning to the captain,
&ldquo;that my brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, never even hinted at
any such plan, and usually he asked my advice in matters of so
great importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easily accounted for, madame,&rdquo; retorted
Kidd. &ldquo;Sir Walter intended this as a little surprise for you,
that is all. The arrangements were all placed in his hands, and it
was he who bound us all to secrecy. None of the ladies were to be
informed of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not sound altogether plausible,&rdquo; interposed
Portia. &ldquo;If you ladies do not object, I should like to
cross-examine this&mdash;ah&mdash;gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kidd paled visibly. He was not prepared for any such trial;
however, he put as good a face on the matter as he could, and
announced his willingness to answer any questions that he might be
asked.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN KIDD CONSENTS TO BE CROSS-EXAMINED BY PORTIA</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we put him under oath?&rdquo; asked Cleopatra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, ladies,&rdquo; said the pirate. &ldquo;A
pirate&rsquo;s word is as good as his bond; but I&rsquo;ll take an
oath if you choose&mdash;a half-dozen of &lsquo;em, if need
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy we can get along without that,&rdquo; said
Portia. &ldquo;Now, Captain Kidd, who first proposed this
plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; said Kidd, unblushingly, with a sly
glance at Xanthippe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Xanthippe. &ldquo;My husband propose
anything that would contribute to my pleasure or intellectual
advancement? Bah! Your story is transparently false at the
outset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Kidd, &ldquo;the scheme was
proposed by Socrates. He said a trip of that kind for Xanthippe
would be very restful and health-giving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; cried Xanthippe, sceptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madame, for him,&rdquo; retorted Kidd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;ho-ho! That&rsquo;s the way of it, eh?&rdquo;
said Xanthippe, flushing to the roots of her hair. &ldquo;Very
likely. You&mdash;ah&mdash;you will excuse my doubting your word,
Captain Kidd, a moment since. I withdraw my remark, and in order to
make fullest reparation, I beg to assure these ladies that I am now
perfectly convinced that you are telling the truth. That last
observation is just like my husband, and when I get back home
again, if I ever do, well&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have a
merry time, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was&mdash;ah&mdash;Bassanio&rsquo;s connection
with this affair?&rdquo; added Portia, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not informed of it,&rdquo; said Kidd, archly.
&ldquo;I am not acquainted with Bassanio, my lady, but I overheard
Sir Walter enjoining upon the others the absolute necessity of
keeping the whole affair from Bassanio, because he was afraid he
would not consent to it. &lsquo;Bassanio has a most beautiful wife,
gentlemen,&rsquo; said Sir Walter, &lsquo;and he wouldn&rsquo;t
think of parting with her under any circumstances; therefore let us
keep our intentions a secret from him.&rsquo; I did not hear whom
the gentleman married, madame; but the others, Prince Hamlet, the
Duke of Buckingham, and Louis the Fourteenth, all agreed that Mrs.
Bassanio was too beautiful a person to be separated from, and that
it was better, therefore, to keep Bassanio in the dark as to their
little enterprise until it was too late for him to
interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pink glow of pleasure suffused the lovely countenance of the
cross-examiner, and it did not require a very sharp eye to see that
the wily Kidd had completely won her over to his side. On the other
hand, Elizabeth&rsquo;s brow became as corrugated as her ruff, and
the spirit of the pirate shivered to the core as he turned and
gazed upon that glowering face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Walter agreed to that, did he?&rdquo; snapped
Elizabeth. &ldquo;And yet he was willing to part
with&mdash;ah&mdash;his sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your Majesty,&rdquo; began Kidd, hesitatingly,
&ldquo;you see it was this way: Sir Walter&mdash;er&mdash;did say
that, but&mdash;ah&mdash;he&mdash;ah&mdash;but he added that he of
course merely judged&mdash;er&mdash;this man Bassanio&rsquo;s
feelings by his own in parting from his sister&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say sister?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no&mdash;not in those words,&rdquo; shuffled
Kidd, perceiving quickly wherein his error lay,
&ldquo;but&mdash;ah&mdash;I jumped at the conclusion, seeing his
intense enthusiasm for the lady&rsquo;s beauty
and&mdash;er&mdash;intellectual qualities, that he referred to you,
and it is from yourself that I have gained my knowledge as to the
fraternal, not to say sororal, relationship that exists between
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man&rsquo;s a diplomat from Diplomaville!&rdquo;
muttered Sir Henry Morgan, who, with Abeuchapeta and Conrad, was
listening at the port without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is that,&rdquo; said Abeuchapeta, &ldquo;but he
can&rsquo;t last much longer. He&rsquo;s perspiring like a pitcher
of ice-water on a hot day, and a spirit of his size and volatile
nature can&rsquo;t stand much of that without evaporating. If you
will observe him closely you will see that his left arm already has
vanished into thin air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; whispered Conrad, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
fact! If they don&rsquo;t let up on him he&rsquo;ll vanish.
He&rsquo;s getting excessively tenuous about the top of his
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of which was only too true. Subjected to a scrutiny which he
had little expected, the deceitful ambassador of the thieving band
was rapidly dissipating, and, as those without had so fearsomely
noted, was in imminent danger of complete sublimation, which, in
the case of one possessed of so little elementary purity, meant
nothing short of annihilation. Fortunately for Kidd, however, his
wonderful tact had stemmed the tide of suspicion. Elizabeth was
satisfied with his explanation, and in the minds of at least three
of the most influential ladies on board, Portia, Xanthippe, and
Elizabeth, he had become a creature worthy of credence, which meant
that he had nothing more to fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am prepared, your Majesty,&rdquo; said Elizabeth,
addressing Cleopatra, &ldquo;to accept from this time on the
gentleman&rsquo;s word. The little that he has already told us is
hall-marked with truth. I should like to ask, however, one more
question, and that is how our gentleman friends expected to embark
us upon this voyage without letting us into the secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as for that,&rdquo; replied Kidd, with a deep-drawn
sigh of relief, for he too had noticed the gradual evaporation of
his arm and the incipient etherization of his
cranium&mdash;&ldquo;as for that, it was simple enough. There was
to have been a day set apart for ladies&rsquo; day at the club, and
when you were all on board we were quietly to weigh anchor and
start. The fact that you had anticipated the day, of your own
volition, was telephoned by my scouts to me at my headquarters, and
that news was by me transmitted by messenger to Sir Walter at
Charon&rsquo;s Glen Island, where the long-talked-of fight between
Samson and Goliath was taking place. Raleigh immediately replied,
&lsquo;<em>Good! Start at once. Paris first. Unlimited credit. Love
to Elizabeth.</em>&rsquo; Wherefore, ladies,&rdquo; he added,
rising from his chair and walking to the
door&mdash;&ldquo;wherefore you are here and in my care. Make
yourselves comfortable, and with the aid of the fashion papers
which you have already received prepare yourselves for the joys
that await you. With the aid of Madame R&eacute;camier and
Baedeker&rsquo;s <em>Paris</em>, which you will find in the
library, it will be your own fault if when you arrive there you
resemble a great many less fortunate women who don&rsquo;t know
what they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Kidd disappeared through the door, and fainted
in the arms of Sir Henry Morgan. The strain upon him had been too
great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming fellow,&rdquo; said Portia, as the pirate
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most attractive,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handsome, too, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; asked Helen
of Troy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And truthful beyond peradventure,&rdquo; observed
Xanthippe, as she reflected upon the words the captain had
attributed to Socrates. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe him at first,
but when he told me what my sweet-tempered philosopher had said, I
was convinced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a sweet child,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Noah,
fondly. &ldquo;One of my favorite grandchildren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which makes it embarrassing for me to say,&rdquo; cried
Cassandra, starting up angrily, &ldquo;that he is a base
caitiff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had a bomb been dropped in the middle of the room, it could not
have created a greater sensation than the words of Cassandra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried several voices at once. &ldquo;A
caitiff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A caitiff with a capital K,&rdquo; retorted Cassandra.
&ldquo;I know that, because while he was telling his story I was
listening to it with one ear and looking forward into the middle of
next week with the other&mdash;I mean the other eye&mdash;and I
saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you saw?&rdquo; cried Cleopatra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that he was deceiving us. Mark my words, ladies, he
is a base caitiff,&rdquo; replied Cassandra&mdash;&ldquo;a base
caitiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Cassandra, and she began a narration of
future events which I must defer to the next chapter. Meanwhile his
associates were endeavoring to restore the evaporated portions of
the prostrated Kidd&rsquo;s spirit anatomy by the use of a
steam-atomizer, but with indifferent success. Kidd&rsquo;s training
had not fitted him for an intellectual combat with superior women,
and he suffered accordingly.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>&ldquo;It is with no desire to interrupt my friend Cassandra
unnecessarily,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah, as the prophetess was about
to narrate her story, &ldquo;that I rise to beg her to remember
that, as an ancestress of Captain Kidd, I hope she will spare a
grandmother&rsquo;s feelings, if anything in the story she is about
to tell is improper to be placed before the young. I have been so
shocked by the stories of perfidy and baseness generally that have
been published of late years, that I would interpose a protest
while there is yet time if there is a line in Cassandra&rsquo;s
story which ought to be withheld from the public; a protest based
upon my affection for posterity, and in the interests of morality
everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may rest easy upon that score, my dear Mrs.
Noah,&rdquo; said the prophetess. &ldquo;What I have to say would
commend itself, I am sure, even to the ears of a British matron;
and while it is as complete a demonstration of man&rsquo;s perfidy
as ever was, it is none the less as harmless a little tale as the
Dottie Dimple books or any other more recent study of New England
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the load your words have lifted from my
mind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah, settling back in her chair, a
satisfied expression upon her gentle countenance. &ldquo;I hope you
will understand why I spoke, and withal why modern literature
generally has been so distressful to me. When you reflect that the
world is satisfied that most of man&rsquo;s criminal instincts are
the result of heredity, and that Mr. Noah and I are unable to shift
the responsibility for posterity to other shoulders than our own,
you will understand my position. We were about the most domestic
old couple that ever lived, and when we see the long and varied
assortment of crimes that are cropping out everywhere in our
descendants it is painful to us to realize what a pair of
unconsciously wicked old fogies we must have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all understand that,&rdquo; said Cleopatra, kindly;
&ldquo;and we are all prepared to acquit you of any responsibility
for the advanced condition of wickedness to-day. Man has progressed
since your time, my dear grandma, and the modern improvements in
the science of crime are no more attributable to you than the
invention of the telephone or the oyster cocktail is attributable
to your lord and master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly,&rdquo; murmured the old lady, and she
resumed her knitting upon a phantom tam-o&rsquo;-shanter, which she
was making as a Christmas surprise for her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Captain Kidd began his story,&rdquo; said Cassandra,
&ldquo;he made one very bad mistake, and yet one which was prompted
by that courtesy which all men instinctively adopt when addressing
women. When he entered the room he removed his hat, and therein lay
his fatal error, if he wished to convince me of the truth of his
story, for with his hat removed I could see the workings of his
mind. While you ladies were watching his lips or his eyes, some of
you taking in the gorgeous details of his dress, all of you hanging
upon his every word, I kept my eye fixed firmly upon his
imagination, and I saw, what you did not, <em>that he was drawing
wholly upon that</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and fortunate,&rdquo; said Cassandra.
&ldquo;Had I not done so, a week hence we should, every one of us,
have been lost in the surging wickedness of the city of
Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Cassandra,&rdquo; said Trilby, who was anxious to
return once more to the beautiful city by the Seine, &ldquo;he told
us we were going to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_19.jpg"><img src=

"&ldquo;&lsquo;HE TOLD US WE WERE GOING TO PARIS&rsquo;&rdquo;" id=
"illo_19" name="illo_19" width="154" height="216" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;HE TOLD US WE WERE GOING TO
PARIS&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did,&rdquo; said Madame R&eacute;camier,
&ldquo;and in so many words. Certainly he was not drawing upon his
imagination there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And one might be lost in a very much worse place,&rdquo;
put in Marguerite de Valois, &ldquo;if, indeed, it were possible to
lose us in Paris at all. I fancy that I know enough about Paris to
find my way about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated Cassandra. &ldquo;What a foolish
little thing you are! You don&rsquo;t imagine that the Paris of
to-day is the Paris of your time, or even the Paris of that sweet
child Trilby&rsquo;s time, do you? If you do you are very much
mistaken. I almost wish I had not warned you of your danger and had
let you go, just to see those eyes of yours open with amazement at
the change. You&rsquo;d find your Louvre a very different sort of a
place from what it used to be, my dear lady. Those pleasing little
windows through which your relations were wont in olden times to
indulge in target practice at people who didn&rsquo;t go to their
church are now kept closed; the galleries which used to swarm with
people, many of whom ought to have been hanged, now swarm with
pictures, many of which ought not to have been hung; the romance
which clung about its walls is as much a part of the dead past as
yourselves, and were you to materialize suddenly therein you would
find yourselves jostled and hustled and trodden upon by the curious
from other lands, with Argus eyes taking in five hundred pictures a
minute, and traversing those halls at a rate of speed at which
Mercury himself would stand aghast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my beloved Tuileries?&rdquo; cried Marie
Antoinette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has been swallowed up by a play-ground for the people, my
dear,&rdquo; said Cassandra, gently. &ldquo;Paris is no place for
us, and it is the intention of these men, in whose hands we are, to
take us there and then desert us. Can you imagine anything worse
than ourselves, the phantoms of a glorious romantic past, basely
deserted in the streets of a wholly strange, superficial, material
city of to-day? What do you think, Elizabeth, would be your fate
if, faint and famished, you begged for sustenance at an English
door to-day, and when asked your name and profession were to reply,
&lsquo;Elizabeth, Queen of England&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insane asylum,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. So in Paris with the rest of us,&rdquo; said
Cassandra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; asked Trilby, still
unconvinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it just as you knew how to become a prima
donna,&rdquo; said Cassandra. &ldquo;I am, however, my own
Svengali, which is rather preferable to the patent detachable
hypnotizer you had. I hypnotize myself, and direct my mind into the
future. I was a professional forecaster in the days of ancient
Troy, and if my revelations had been heeded the Priam family would,
I doubt not, still be doing business at the old stand, and Mr.
&AElig;neas would not have grown round-shouldered giving his poor
father a picky-back ride on the opening night of the horse-show, so
graphically depicted by Virgil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard about that,&rdquo; said Trilby. &ldquo;It
sounds like a very funny story, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t so humorous for some as it was for
others,&rdquo; said Cassandra, with a sly glance at Helen.
&ldquo;The fact is, until you mentioned it yourself, it never
occurred to me that there was much fun in any portion of the Trojan
incident, excepting perhaps the delirium tremens of old Laocoon,
who got no more than he deserved for stealing my thunder. I had
warned Troy against the Greeks, and they all laughed at me, and
said my eye to the future was strabismatic; that the Greeks
couldn&rsquo;t get into Troy at all, even if they wanted to. And
then the Greeks made a great wooden horse as a gift for the
Trojans, and when I turned my X-ray gaze upon it I saw that it
contained about six brigades of infantry, three artillery
regiments, and sharp-shooters by the score. It was a sort of
military Noah&rsquo;s Ark; but I knew that the prejudice against me
was so strong that nobody would believe what I told them. So I said
nothing. My prophecies never came true, they said, failing to
observe that my warning as to what would be was in itself the cause
of their non-fulfilment. But desiring to save Troy, I sent for
Laocoon and told him all about it, and he went out and announced it
as his own private prophecy; and then, having tried to drown his
conscience in strong waters, he fell a victim to the usual
serpentine hallucination, and everybody said he wasn&rsquo;t sober,
and therefore unworthy of belief. The horse was accepted, hauled
into the city, and that night orders came from hindquarters to the
regiments concealed inside to march. They marched, and next morning
Troy had been removed from the map; ninety per cent. of the Trojans
died suddenly, and &AElig;neas, grabbing up his family in one hand
and his gods in the other, went yachting for several seasons,
ultimately settling down in Italy. All of this could have been
avoided if the Trojans would have taken the hint from my
prophecies. They preferred, however, not to do it, with the result
that to-day no one but Helen and myself knows even where Troy was,
and we&rsquo;ll never tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all true,&rdquo; said Helen, proudly. &ldquo;I was
the woman who was at the bottom of it all, and I can testify that
Cassandra always told the truth, which is why she was always so
unpopular. When anything that was unpleasant happened, after it was
all over she would turn and say, sweetly, &lsquo;I told you
so.&rsquo; She was the original &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo;
nuisance, and of course she had the newspapyruses down on her,
because she never left them any sensation to spring upon the
public. If she had only told a fib once in a while, the public
would have had more confidence in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your endorsement,&rdquo; said Cassandra,
with a nod at Helen. &ldquo;With such testimony I cannot see how
you can refrain from taking my advice in this matter; and I tell
you, ladies, that this man Kidd has made his story up out of whole
cloth; the men of Hades had no more to do with our being here than
we had; they were as much surprised as we are to find us gone. Kidd
himself was not aware of our presence, and his object in taking us
to Paris is to leave us stranded there, disembodied spirits,
vagrant souls with no familiar haunts to haunt, no place to rest,
and nothing before us save perpetual exile in a world that would
have no sympathy for us in our misfortune, and no belief in our
continued existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, then, shall we do?&rdquo; cried Ophelia,
wringing her hands in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a terrible problem,&rdquo; said Cleopatra,
anxiously; &ldquo;and yet it does seem as if our woman&rsquo;s
instinct ought to show us some way out of our trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Committee on Treachery,&rdquo; said Delilah,
&ldquo;has already suggested a chafing-dish party, with Lucretia
Borgia in charge of the lobster Newberg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Lucretia; &ldquo;but I find, in
going through my reticule, that my maid, for some reason unknown to
me, has failed to renew my supply of poisons. I shall discharge her
on my return home, for she knows that I never go anywhere without
them; but that does not help matters at this juncture. The sad fact
remains that I could prepare a thousand delicacies for these
pirates without fatal results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean immediately fatal, do you not?&rdquo; suggested
Xanthippe. &ldquo;I could myself prepare a cake which would in time
reduce our captors to a state of absolute dependence, but of course
the effect is not immediate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might give a musicale, and let Trilby sing &lsquo;Ben
Bolt&rsquo; to them,&rdquo; suggested Marguerite de Valois, with a
giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be flippant, please,&rdquo; said Portia.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t time to waste on flippant suggestions.
Perhaps a court-martial of these pirates, supplemented by a
yard-arm, wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing. I&rsquo;ll prosecute the
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that you are dealing with immortal
spirits,&rdquo; observed Cleopatra. &ldquo;If these creatures were
mortals, hanging them would be all right, and comparatively easy,
considering that we outnumber them ten to one, and have many
resources for getting them, more or less, in our power, but they
are not. They have gone through the refining process of dissolution
once, and there&rsquo;s an end to that. Our only resource is in the
line of deception, and if we cannot deceive them, then we have
ceased to be women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is truly said,&rdquo; observed Elizabeth. &ldquo;And
inasmuch as we have already provided ourselves with a suitable
committee for the preparation of our plans of a deceptive nature, I
move, as the easiest possible solution of the difficulty for the
rest of us, that the Committee on Treachery be requested to go at
once into executive session, with orders not to come out of it
until they have suggested a plausible plan of campaign against our
abductors. We must be rid of them. Let the Committee on Treachery
say how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;You are
a very clear-headed young woman, Lizzie, and your grandmother is
proud of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_20.jpg"><img src=

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;YOU ARE A VERY CLEAR-HEADED YOUNG WOMAN,
LIZZIE,&rsquo; SAID MRS. NOAH&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Committee on Treachery were about to protest, but the chair
refused to entertain any debate upon the question, which was put
and carried with a storm of approval.</p>
<p>Five minutes later a note was handed through the port, addressed
to Cleopatra, which read as follows:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Madame</span>,&mdash;Six bells has
just struck, and the officers and crew are hungry. Will you and
your fair companions co-operate with us in our enterprise by having
a hearty dinner ready within two hours? A speck has appeared on the
horizon which betokens a coming storm, else we would prepare our
supper ourselves. As it is, we feel that your safety depends on our
remaining on deck. If there is any beer on the ice, we prefer it to
tea. Two cases will suffice.</p>
<p class="rgt">&ldquo;Yours respectfully,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="sc">Henry Morgan</span>, Bart., First
Mate.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Cleopatra, as she read this
communication. &ldquo;I have an idea. Tell the Committee on
Treachery to appear before the full meeting at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The committee was summoned, and Cleopatra announced her plan of
operation, and it was unanimously adopted; but what it was we shall
have to wait for another chapter to learn.</p>

<p>When Captain Holmes arrived upon deck he seized his glass, and,
gazing intently through it for a moment, perceived that the
faithful Shem had not deceived him. Flying at half-mast from a
rude, roughly hewn pole set upon a rocky height was the black flag,
emblem of piracy, and, as Artemus Ward put it, &ldquo;with the
second joints reversed.&rdquo; It was in very truth a signal of
distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make it a point never to be surprised,&rdquo; observed
Holmes, as he peered through the glass, &ldquo;but this beats me. I
didn&rsquo;t know there was an island of this nature in these
latitudes. Blackstone, go below and pipe Captain Cook on deck.
Perhaps he knows what island that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to excuse me, Captain Holmes,&rdquo;
replied the Judge. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ship on this voyage as a
cabin-boy or a messenger-boy. Therefore I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonaparte, put the Judge in irons,&rdquo; interrupted
Holmes, sternly. &ldquo;I expect to be obeyed, Judge Blackstone,
whether you shipped as a Lord Chief-Justice or a state-room
steward. When I issue an order it must be obeyed. Step lively
there, Bonaparte. Get his honor ironed and summon your marines. We
may have work to do before night. Hamlet, pipe Captain Cook on
deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; replied Hamlet, with alacrity, as
he made off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to obey orders,&rdquo; said Holmes,
with a scornful glance at Blackstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only jesting, Captain,&rdquo; said the latter,
paling somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Holmes, taking up his
glass again. &ldquo;So was I when I ordered you in irons, and in
order that you may appreciate the full force of the joke I repeat
it. Bonaparte, do your duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant the order was obeyed, and the unhappy Judge
shortly found himself manacled and alone in the forecastle.
Meanwhile Captain Cook, in response to the commander&rsquo;s order,
repaired to the deck and scanned the distant coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t place it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t be Monte Cristo, can it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Count, who stood hard
by. &ldquo;My island was in the Mediterranean, and even if it
dragged anchor it couldn&rsquo;t have got out through the Strait of
Gibraltar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s island,&rdquo;
suggested Doctor Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not it,&rdquo; observed De Foe. &ldquo;If it is, the rest
of you will please keep off. It&rsquo;s mine, and I may want to use
it again. I&rsquo;ve been having a number of interviews with Crusoe
latterly, and he&rsquo;s given me a lot of new points, which I
intend incorporating in a sequel for the <em>Cimmerian
Magazine</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the name of Atlas, what island is it,
then?&rdquo; roared Holmes, angrily. &ldquo;What is the matter with
all you learned lubbers that I have brought along on this trip? Do
you suppose I&rsquo;ve brought you to whistle up favorable winds?
Not by the beard of the Prophet! I brought you to give me
information, and now when I ask for the name of a simple little
island like that in plain sight there&rsquo;s not one of you able
so much as to guess at it reasonably. The next man I ask for
information goes into irons with Judge Blackstone if he
doesn&rsquo;t answer me instantly with the information I want.
Munchausen, what island is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem! that?&rdquo; replied Munchausen, trembling, as he
reflected upon the Captain&rsquo;s threat. &ldquo;What? Nobody
knows what island that is? Why, you surprise me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Baron,&rdquo; retorted Holmes, menacingly,
&ldquo;I ask you a plain question, and I want a plain answer, with
no evasions to gain time. Now it&rsquo;s irons or an answer. What
island is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an island that doesn&rsquo;t appear on any
chart, Captain,&rdquo; Munchausen responded instantly, pulling
himself together for a mighty effort, &ldquo;and it has never been
given a name; but as you insist upon having one, we&rsquo;ll call
it Holmes Island, in your honor. It is not stationary. It is a
floating island of lava formation, and is a menace to every craft
that goes to sea. I spent a year of my life upon it once, and it is
more barren than the desert of Sahara, because you cannot raise
even sand upon it, and it is devoid of water of any sort, salt or
fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you live on during that year?&rdquo; asked
Holmes, eying him narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canned food from wrecks,&rdquo; replied the Baron,
feeling much easier now that he had got a fair
start&mdash;&ldquo;canned food from wrecks, commander. There is a
magnetic property in the upper stratum of this piece of derelict
real estate, sir, which attracts to it every bit of canned
substance that is lost overboard in all parts of the world. A ship
is wrecked, say, in the Pacific Ocean, and ultimately all the loose
metal upon her will succumb to the irresistible attraction of this
magnetic upper stratum, and will find its way to its shores. So in
any other part of the earth. Everything metallic turns up here
sooner or later; and when you consider that thousands of vessels go
down every year, vessels which are provisioned with tinned foods
only, you will begin to comprehend how many millions of pounds of
preserved salmon, sardines, <em>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foie
gras</em>, peaches, and so on, can be found strewn along its
coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Munchausen,&rdquo; said Holmes, smiling, &ldquo;by the
blush upon your cheek, coupled with an occasional uneasy glance of
the eye, I know that for once you are standing upon the, to you,
unfamiliar ground of truth, and I admire you for it. There is
nothing to be ashamed of in telling the truth occasionally. You are
a man after my own heart. Come below and have a cocktail. Captain
Cook, take command of the <em>Gehenna</em> during my absence; head
her straight for Holmes Island, and when you discover anything new
let me know. Bonaparte, in honor of Munchausen&rsquo;s remarkable
genius I proclaim general amnesty to our prisoners, and you may
release Blackstone from his dilemma; and if you have any tin
soldiers among your marines, see that they are lashed to the
rigging. I don&rsquo;t want this electric island of the
Baron&rsquo;s to get a grip upon my military force at this
juncture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Holmes, followed by Munchausen, went below, and the
two worthies were soon deep in the mysteries of a phantom cocktail,
while Doctor Johnson and De Foe gazed mournfully out over the ocean
at the floating island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Foe,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;that ought to be a
lesson to you. This realism that you tie up to is all right when
you are alone with your conscience; but when there are great things
afoot, an imagination and a broad view as to the limitations of
truth aren&rsquo;t at all bad. You or I might now be drinking that
cocktail with Holmes if we&rsquo;d only risen to the opportunity
the way Munchausen did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_21.jpg"><img src=

"Two men stand talking by the rail of a ship" title=
"&ldquo;&lsquo;THAT OUGHT TO BE A LESSON TO YOU&rsquo;&rdquo;" id=

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;THAT OUGHT TO BE A LESSON TO YOU&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said De Foe, sadly. &ldquo;But I
didn&rsquo;t suppose he wanted that kind of information. I could
have spun a better yarn than that of Munchausen&rsquo;s with my
eyes shut. I supposed he wanted truth, and I gave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what has become of the
House-boat,&rdquo; said Raleigh, anxiously gazing through the glass
at the island. &ldquo;I can see old Henry Morgan sitting down there
on the rocks with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his
hands, and Kidd and Abeuchapeta are standing back of him, yelling
like mad, but there isn&rsquo;t a boat in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that man, off to the right, dancing a
fandango?&rdquo; asked Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like Conrad, but I can&rsquo;t tell. He appears
to have gone crazy. He&rsquo;s got that wild look on his face which
betokens insanity. We&rsquo;ll have to be careful in our parleyings
with these people,&rdquo; said Raleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything new?&rdquo; asked Holmes, returning to the deck,
smacking his lips in enjoyment of the cocktail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;except that we are almost within hailing
distance,&rdquo; said Cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then give orders to cast anchor,&rdquo; observed Holmes.
&ldquo;Bonaparte, take a crew of picked men ashore and bring those
pirates aboard. Take the three musketeers with you, and don&rsquo;t
let Kidd or Morgan give you any back talk. If they try any funny
business, exorcise them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; replied Bonaparte, and in a moment
a boat had been lowered and a sturdy crew of sailors were pulling
for the shore. As they came within ten feet of it the pirates made
a mad dash down the rough, rocky hillside and clamored to be
saved.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_22.jpg"><img src=

id="illo_22" name="illo_22" width="216" height="160" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;THE PIRATES MADE A MAD DASH DOWN THE ROUGH, ROCKY
HILL-SIDE&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to you?&rdquo; cried Bonaparte,
ordering the sailors to back water, lest the pirates should too
hastily board the boat and swamp her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are marooned,&rdquo; replied Kidd, &ldquo;and on an
island of a volcanic nature. There isn&rsquo;t a square inch of it
that isn&rsquo;t heated up to 125 degrees, and seventeen of us have
already evaporated. Conrad has lost his reason; Abeuchapeta has
become so tenuous that a child can see through him. As for myself,
I am growing iridescent with anxiety, and unless I get off this
infernal furnace I&rsquo;ll disappear like a soap-bubble. For
Heaven&rsquo;s sake, then, General, take us off, on your own terms.
We&rsquo;ll accept anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in confirmation of Kidd&rsquo;s words, six of the pirate
crew collapsed and disappeared into thin air, and a glance at
Abeuchapeta was proof enough of his condition. He had become as
clear as crystal, and had it not been for his rugged outlines he
would hardly have been visible even to his fellow-spirits. As for
Kidd, he had taken on the aspect of a rainbow, and it was patent
that his fears for himself were all too well founded.</p>
<p>Bonaparte embarked the leaders of the band first, returning
subsequently for the others, and repaired with them at once to the
<em>Gehenna</em>, where they were ushered into the presence of
Sherlock Holmes. The first question he asked was as to the
whereabouts of the House-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we do not know,&rdquo; replied Kidd, mournfully,
gazing downward at the wreck of his former self. &ldquo;We came
ashore, sir, early yesterday morning, in search of food. It appears
that when&mdash;acting in a wholly inexcusable fashion, and
influenced, I confess it, by motives of revenge&mdash;I made off
with your club-house, I neglected to ascertain if it were well
stocked with provisions, a fatal error; for when we endeavored to
get supper we discovered that the larder contained but half a
bottle of farcie olives, two salted almonds, and a soda
cracker&mdash;not a luxurious feast for sixty-nine pirates and a
hundred and eighty-three women to sit down to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; said Demosthenes.
&ldquo;The House Committee had provided enough supper for six
hundred people, in anticipation of the appetite of the members on
their return from the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they did,&rdquo; said Confucius; &ldquo;and it
was a good one, too&mdash;salads, salmon glac&eacute;,
lobsters&mdash;every blessed thing a man can&rsquo;t get at home we
had; and what is more, they&rsquo;d been delivered on board. I saw
to that before I went up the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; moaned Kidd, &ldquo;it is as I suspected. We
were the victims of base treachery on the part of those
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treachery? Well, I like that. Call it reciprocity,&rdquo;
said Hamlet, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were informed by the ladies that there was nothing for
supper save the items I have already referred to,&rdquo; said Kidd.
&ldquo;I see it all now. We had tried to make them comfortable, and
I put myself to some considerable personal inconvenience to make
them easy in their minds, but they were ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever induced you to take &lsquo;em along with
you?&rdquo; asked Socrates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want them,&rdquo; said Kidd. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t know they were on board until it was too late to turn
back. They&rsquo;d broken in, and were having the club all to
themselves in your absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It served you good and right,&rdquo; said Socrates, with
a laugh. &ldquo;Next time you try to take things that don&rsquo;t
belong to you, maybe you&rsquo;ll be a trifle more careful as to
whose property you confiscate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the House-boat&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t told us how
you lost her,&rdquo; put in Raleigh, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was this way,&rdquo; said Kidd. &ldquo;When, in
response to our polite request for supper, the ladies said there
was nothing to eat on board, something had to be done, for we were
all as hungry as bears, and we decided to go ashore at the first
port and provision. Unfortunately the crew got restive, and when
this floating frying-pan loomed into view, to keep them
good-natured we decided to land and see if we could beg, borrow, or
steal some supplies. We had to. Observations taken with the sextant
showed that there was no port within five hundred miles; the island
looked as if it might be inhabited at least by goats, and ashore we
went, every man of us, leaving the House-boat safely anchored in
the harbor. At first we didn&rsquo;t mind the heat, and we hunted
and hunted and hunted; but after three or four hours I began to
notice that three of my sailors were shrivelling up, and Conrad
began to act as if he were daft. Hawkins burst right before my
eyes. Then Abeuchapeta got prismatic around the eyes and began to
fade, and I noticed a slight iridescence about myself; and as for
Morgan, he had the misfortune to lie down to take a nap in the sun,
and when he waked up, his whole right side had evaporated. Then we
saw what the trouble was. We&rsquo;d struck this lava island, and
were gradually succumbing to its intense heat. We rushed madly back
to the harbor to embark; and our ship, gentlemen, and your
House-boat, was slowly but surely disappearing over the horizon,
and flying from the flag-staff at the fore were signals of
farewell, with an unfeeling P.S. below to this effect:
&lsquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t wait up for us. We may not be back until
late.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which Socrates laughed quietly to
himself, while Abeuchapeta and the one-sided Morgan wept
silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, gentlemen of the Associated Shades, is all I know
of the whereabouts of the House-boat,&rdquo; continued Captain
Kidd. &ldquo;I have no doubt that the ladies practised a deception,
to our discomfiture, and I must say that I think it was exceedingly
clever&mdash;granting that it was desirable to be rid of us, which
I don&rsquo;t, for we meant well by them, and they would have
enjoyed themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Hamlet, &ldquo;may they not now be in
peril? They cannot navigate that ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got her out of the harbor all right,&rdquo; said
Kidd. &ldquo;And I judged from the figure at the helm that Mrs.
Noah had taken charge. What kind of a seaman she is I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almighty bad,&rdquo; ejaculated Shem, turning pale.
&ldquo;It was she who ran us ashore on Ararat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wasn&rsquo;t that what you wanted?&rdquo; queried
Munchausen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we wanted!&rdquo; cried Shem. &ldquo;Well, I guess
not. You don&rsquo;t want your yacht stranded on a mountain-top, do
you? She was a dead loss there, whereas if mother hadn&rsquo;t been
in such a hurry to get ashore, we could have waited a month and
landed on the seaboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have turned her into a summer hotel,&rdquo;
suggested Munchausen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must up anchor and away,&rdquo; said Holmes.
&ldquo;Our pursuit has merely begun, apparently. We must overtake
this vessel, and the question to be answered
is&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; said Artemus Ward. &ldquo;From
what Shem says, I think we&rsquo;d better look for her in the
Himalayas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, meanwhile, what shall be done with Kidd?&rdquo;
asked Holmes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be expelled from the club,&rdquo; said
Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t expel him, because he&rsquo;s not a
member,&rdquo; replied Raleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then elect him,&rdquo; suggested Ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth for?&rdquo; growled Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that we can expel him,&rdquo; said Ward.</p>
<p>And while Boswell&rsquo;s hero was trying to get the value of
this notion through his head, the others repaired to the deck, and
the <em>Gehenna</em> was soon under way once more. Meanwhile
Captain Kidd and his fellows were put in irons and stowed away in
the forecastle, alongside of the water-cask in which Shylock lay in
hiding.</p>

<h2>The Escape and the End</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>If there was anxiety on board of the <em>Gehenna</em> as to the
condition and whereabouts of the House-boat, there was by no means
less uneasiness upon that vessel itself. Cleopatra&rsquo;s scheme
for ridding herself and her abducted sisters of the pirates had
worked to a charm, but, having worked thus, a new and hitherto
undreamed-of problem, full of perplexities bearing upon their
immediate safety, now confronted them. The sole representative of a
sea-faring family on board was Mrs. Noah, and it did not require
much time to see that her knowledge as to navigation was of an
extremely primitive order, limited indeed to the science of
floating.</p>
<p>When the last pirate had disappeared behind the rocks of Holmes
Island, and all was in readiness for action, the good old lady, who
had hitherto been as calm and unruffled as a child, began to get
red in the face and to bustle about in a manner which betrayed
considerable perturbation of spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mrs. Noah,&rdquo; said Cleopatra, as, peeping out
from the billiard-room window, she saw Morgan disappearing in the
distance, &ldquo;the coast is clear, and I resign my position of
chairman to you. We place the vessel in your hands, and ourselves
subject to your orders. You are in command. What do you wish us to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Noah, putting down her
knitting and starting for the deck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain,
but I think the first thing to do is to get her moving. Do you
know, I&rsquo;ve never discovered whether this boat is a steamboat
or a sailing-vessel? Does anybody know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it has a naphtha tank and a propeller,&rdquo;
said Elizabeth, &ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t know. It seems to me
my brother Raleigh told me they&rsquo;d had a naphtha engine put in
last winter after the freshet, when the House-boat was carried ten
miles down the river, and had to be towed back at enormous expense.
They put it in so that if she were carried away again she could get
back of her own power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah,
&ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t know anything about these new fangled
notions. If there&rsquo;s any one here who knows anything about
naphtha engines, I wish they&rsquo;d speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m of the opinion,&rdquo; said Portia, &ldquo;that
I can study out the theory of it in a short while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah, &ldquo;you can do
it. I&rsquo;ll appoint you engineer, and give you all your orders
now, right away, in advance. Set her going and keep her going, and
don&rsquo;t stop without a written order signed by me. We might as
well be very careful, and have everything done properly, and it
might happen that in the excitement of our trip you would
misunderstand my spoken orders and make a fatal error. Therefore,
pay no attention to unwritten orders. That will do for you for the
present. Xanthippe, you may take Ophelia and Madame
R&eacute;camier, and ten other ladies, and, every morning before
breakfast, swab the larboard deck. Cassandra, Tuesdays you will
devote to polishing the brasses in the dining-room, and the balance
of your time I wish you to expend in dusting the bric-a-brac. Dido,
you always were strong at building fires. I&rsquo;ll make you chief
stoker. You will also assist Lucretia Borgia in the kitchen.
Inasmuch as the latter&rsquo;s maid has neglected to supply her
with the usual line of poisons, I think we can safely entrust to
Lucretia&rsquo;s hands the responsibilities of the culinary
department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly willing to do anything I can,&rdquo;
said Lucretia, &ldquo;but I must confess that I don&rsquo;t approve
of your methods of commanding a ship. A ship&rsquo;s captain
isn&rsquo;t a domestic martinet, as you are setting out to be. We
didn&rsquo;t appoint you housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah, firmly, &ldquo;I do
not wish any words. If I hear any more impudence from you,
I&rsquo;ll put you ashore without a reference; and the rest of you
I would warn in all kindness that I will not tolerate
insubordination. You may, all of you, have one night of the week
and alternate Sundays off, but your work must be done. The regimen
I am adopting is precisely that in vogue on the Ark, only I
didn&rsquo;t have the help I have now, and things got into very bad
shape. We were out forty days, and, while the food was poor and the
service execrable, we never lost a life.&rdquo;</p>

"&ldquo;&lsquo;NOW, MY CHILD,&rsquo; SAID MRS. NOAH, FIRMLY, &lsquo;I DO NOT WISH ANY WORDS&rsquo;&rdquo;"
id="illo_23" name="illo_23" width="216" height="134" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;NOW, MY CHILD,&rsquo; SAID MRS. NOAH, FIRMLY,
&lsquo;I DO NOT WISH ANY WORDS&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The boat gave a slight tremor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, clapping her hands with
glee, &ldquo;we are off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will repair to the deck and get our bearings,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Noah, putting her shawl over her shoulders.
&ldquo;Meantime, Cleopatra, I appoint you first mate. See that
things are tidied up a bit here before I return. Have the windows
washed, and to-morrow I want all the rugs and carpets taken up and
shaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portia meanwhile had discovered the naphtha engine, and, after
experimenting several times with the various levers and stop-cocks,
had finally managed to move one of them in such a way as to set the
engine going, and the wheel began to revolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going all right?&rdquo; she cried, from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; said the gallant commander.
&ldquo;The wheel is roiling up the water at a great rate, but we
don&rsquo;t seem to be going ahead very fast&mdash;in fact,
we&rsquo;re simply moving round and round as though we were on a
pivot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re aground amidships,&rdquo;
said Xanthippe, gazing over the side of the House-boat anxiously.
&ldquo;She certainly acts that way&mdash;like a
merry-go-round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s something wrong,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Noah; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve got to hurry and find out what it is,
or those men will be back and we shall be as badly off as
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this has something to do with it,&rdquo; observed
Mrs. Lot, pointing to the anchor rope. &ldquo;It looks to me as if
those horrid men had tied us fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what it is,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Noah.
&ldquo;They guessed our plan, and have fastened us to a pole or
something, but I imagine we can untie it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portia, who had come on deck, gave a short little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course we don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; she
said&mdash;&ldquo;we are anchored!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;We
never had an experience like that on the Ark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portia explained the science of the anchor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;How
can we get away from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to pull it up,&rdquo; said Portia.
&ldquo;Order all hands on deck and have it pulled up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done, and, if it could, I
wouldn&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah, indignantly.
&ldquo;The idea! Lifting heavy pieces of iron, my dear Portia, is
not a woman&rsquo;s work. Send for Delilah, and let her cut the
rope with her scissors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take her a week to cut a hawser like
that,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, who had been investigating. &ldquo;It
would be more to the purpose, I think, to chop it in two with an
axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Noah, satisfied. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t care how it is done as long as it is done quickly. It
would never do for us to be recaptured now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion of Elizabeth was carried out, and the queen
herself cut the hawser with six well-directed strokes of the
axe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> an expert with it, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; smiled Cleopatra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, grimly. &ldquo;I
had it suspended over my head for so long a time before I got to
the throne that I couldn&rsquo;t help familiarizing myself with
some of its possibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Noah, as the vessel began to move.
&ldquo;I begin to feel easier. It looks now as if we were really
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, though,&rdquo; said Cleopatra, gazing
forward, &ldquo;that we are going backward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, what if we are!&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah.
&ldquo;We did that on the Ark half the time. It doesn&rsquo;t make
any difference which way we are going as long as we go, does
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it does!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth.
&ldquo;What can you be thinking of? People who walk backward are in
great danger of running into other people. Why not the same with
ships? It seems to me, it&rsquo;s a very dangerous piece of
business, sailing backward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;You are as
timid as a zebra. During the Flood, we sailed days and days and
days, going backward. It didn&rsquo;t make a particle of difference
how we went&mdash;it was as safe one way as another, and we got
just as far away in the end. Our main object now is to get away
from the pirates, and that&rsquo;s what we are doing. Don&rsquo;t
get emotional, Lizzie, and remember, too, that I am in charge. If I
think the boat ought to go sideways, sideways she shall go. If you
don&rsquo;t like it, it is still not too late to put you
ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threat calmed Elizabeth somewhat, and she was satisfied, and
all went well with them, even if Portia had started the propeller
revolving reverse fashion; so that the House-boat was, as Elizabeth
had said, backing her way through the ocean.</p>
<p>The day passed, and by slow degrees the island and the marooned
pirates faded from view, and the night came on, and with it a dense
fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a nasty night, I am
afraid,&rdquo; said Xanthippe, looking anxiously out of the
port.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah, pleasantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for those who have to be out in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking about,&rdquo; observed
Xanthippe. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be very hard on us keeping
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch for what?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Noah, looking over
the tops of her glasses at Xanthippe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, surely you are going to have lookouts stationed on
deck?&rdquo; said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;Perfectly
absurd. We never did it on the Ark, and it isn&rsquo;t necessary
now. I want you all to go to bed at ten o&rsquo;clock. I
don&rsquo;t think the night air is good for you. Besides, it
isn&rsquo;t proper for a woman to be out after dark, whether
she&rsquo;s new or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Mrs. Noah,&rdquo; expostulated Cleopatra,
&ldquo;what will become of the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;ll float through the night whether we
are on deck or not,&rdquo; said the commander. &ldquo;The Ark did,
why not this? Now, girls, these new-fangled yachting notions are
all nonsense. It&rsquo;s night, and there&rsquo;s a fog as thick as
a stone-wall all about us. If there were a hundred of you upon deck
with ten eyes apiece, you couldn&rsquo;t see anything. You might
much better be in bed. As your captain, chaperon, and grandmother,
I command you to stay below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;who is to steer?&rdquo; queried Xanthippe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of steering until we can see where
to steer to?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Noah. &ldquo;I certainly
don&rsquo;t intend to bother with that tiller until some reason for
doing it arises. We haven&rsquo;t any place to steer to yet; we
don&rsquo;t know where we are going. Now, my dear children, be
reasonable, and don&rsquo;t worry me. I&rsquo;ve had a very hard
day of it, and I feel my responsibilities keenly. Just let me
manage, and we&rsquo;ll come out all right. I&rsquo;ve had more
experience than any of you, and if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A terrible crash interrupted the old lady&rsquo;s remarks. The
House-boat shivered and shook, careened way to one side, and as
quickly righted and stood still. A mad rush up the gangway
followed, and in a moment a hundred and eighty-three pale-faced,
trembling women stood upon the deck, gazing with horror at a great
helpless hulk ten feet to the rear, fastened by broken ropes and
odd pieces of rigging to the stern-posts of the House-boat, sinking
slowly but surely into the sea.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illo_24.jpg"><img src=

<p>&ldquo;A GREAT HELPLESS HULK TEN FEET TO THE REAR&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was the <em>Gehenna</em>!</p>
<p>The House-boat had run her down and her last hour had come, but,
thanks to the stanchness of her build and wonderful beam, the
floating club-house had withstood the shock of the impact and now
rode the waters as gracefully as ever.</p>
<p>Portia was the first to realize the extent of the catastrophe,
and in a short while chairs and life-preservers and
tables&mdash;everything that could float&mdash;had been tossed into
the sea to the struggling immortals therein. On board the
<em>Gehenna</em>, those who had not cast themselves into the
waters, under the cool direction of Holmes and Bonaparte, calmly
lowered the boats, and in a short while were not only able to
felicitate themselves upon their safety, but had likewise the good
fortune to rescue their more impetuous brethren who had preferred
to swim for it. Ultimately, all were brought aboard the House-boat
in safety, and the men in Hades were once more reunited to their
wives, daughters, sisters, and <em>fianc&eacute;es</em>, and
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of once more saving the life of
Raleigh by throwing him her ruff as she had done a year or so
previously, when she and her brother had been upset in the swift
current of the river Styx.</p>
<p>Order and happiness being restored, Holmes took command of the
House-boat and soon navigated her safely back into her old-time
berth. The <em>Gehenna</em> went to the bottom and was never seen
again, and when the roll was called it was found that all who had
set out upon her had returned in safety save Shylock, Kidd, Sir
Henry Morgan, and Abeuchapeta; but even they were not lost, for,
five weeks later, these four worthies were found early one morning
drifting slowly up the river Styx, gazing anxiously out from the
top of a water-cask and yelling lustily for help.</p>
<p>And here endeth the chronicle of the pursuit of the good old
House-boat. Back to her moorings, the even tenor of her ways was
once more resumed, but with one slight difference.</p>
<p>The ladies became eligible for membership, and, availing
themselves of the privilege, began to think less and less of the
advantages of being men and to rejoice that, after all, they were
women; and even Xanthippe and Socrates, after that night of peril,
reconciled their differences, and no longer quarrel as to which is
the more entitled to wear the toga of authority. It has become for
them a divided skirt.</p>
<p>As for Kidd and his fellows, they have never recovered from the
effects of their fearful, though short, exile upon Holmes Island,
and are but shadows of their former shades; whereas Mr. Sherlock
Holmes has so endeared himself to his new-found friends that he is
quite as popular with them as he is with us, who have yet to cross
the dark river and be subjected to the scrutiny of the Committee on
Membership at the House-boat on the Styx.</p>
<p>Even Hawkshaw has been able to detect his genius.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
