description: A house-boat floats down the river Styx, which must be crossed to enter
  the afterworld. At the end of A House-Boat on the Styx Captain Kidd hijacks the
  boat. In this sequel, the houseboat club-members hire Sherlock Holmes (at that point
  in history declared dead by his creator) to investigate the matter.
